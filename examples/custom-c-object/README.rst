====================
Example Custom objects.
====================

This creates two new objects for the ECMAScript engine. These objects are as 
follows...

Shape Object type - A simple object that also uses a built in ecmascript 
function to override the toString built in.

vector2D Object type - A more complex object that features user pointers, two
pairs of getter and setter functions, and a c powered toString function. This
also shows how to customize the constructor with variable arguments and 
argument types.
