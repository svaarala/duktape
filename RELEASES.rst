0.9.0 (2014-02-02)
------------------

* Added duk_gc() API call to force GC, implemented duk_map_string() and
  duk_decode_string()

* Added extended JSON format variants JSONX and JSONC; NULL pointer
  values string now coerce to "null" instead of e.g. "(nil)" to match
  JSONX format

* Added input line number to compiler error messages (e.g. SyntaxErrors)

* Added support for function declarations outside function or program top
  level (also known as "function statements"), with V8-like semantics

* Renamed __duk__ to Duktape for more consistency with ECMAScript conventions

* Removed somewhat useless Duktape.build property and added Duktape.env

* Replaced Duktape.addr() and Duktape.refc() with Duktape.info() which gives
  more internal info

* Merged Duktape.setFinalizer() and Duktape.getFinalizer() into a single
  Duktape.fin() call

* Some compatibility properties available for now (e.g. __duk__), but these
  will be removed after this release

* Removed array size limit for very large array joins

* Improve Unicode handling of Greek final sigma

* Make mark-and-sweep interval relative to current heap size (measured as
  combined object and string count)

* Add DUK_OPT_NO_VOLUNTARY_GC to disable voluntary mark-and-sweep entirely;
  this is useful in timing sensitive applications like games

* Preliminary internal support for periodic bytecode executor interrupts
  which can be used to implement executor step limits, profiling, and
  debugging

* More feature options for build tuning

* More self tests to detect obscure compiler bugs, two's complement
  arithmetic, etc (enable with DUK_OPT_SELF_TESTS)

* Fixed several compile warnings, fixed warnings generated by GCC -Wextra

* Fixed some incorrect assertions (with no underlying bug)

* Fixed a coroutine termination bug which caused assertion errors and
  occasional segfaults when an uncaught error terminated a thread with
  a catch point active

* Fixed a tail call bug: the current activation was not closed which
  caused variable lookups to fail if an inner function accessed
  variables in the surrounding activation

* Fixed a few bound constructor bugs

* Fixed handling of "get" and "set": they were handled as reserved words
  which prevented valid statements like "var set = 1;"

* Fixed a switch-case bug where code was accepted before the first
  case/default clause

* Fixed a switch-case bug where successive case clauses with no code
  in-between was not handled correctly

* Fixed a for statement control flow bug when the third clause of the for
  statement was empty and a continue was used

* Fixed error lineNumber bug triggered when there was more than 127
  source lines between successive compiled statements

* Fixed some line terminator handling issues

* Fixed relational operator ToPrimitive() coercion order, for some
  operators coercion order was reversed

* Fixed 'with' statement in strict mode (did not throw SyntaxError)

* Fixed strictness handling of an indirect eval call from a strict
  function (eval incorrectly inherited strict mode)

* Several test262 and underscore.js test case fixes (other than above)

* Windows compatibility for both WIN32 and WIN64, tested with MinGW (x86),
  MINGW-w64 (x64), VS2010 Express (x32), VS2013 Express (x32 and x64)

* Portability fixes for non-C99 platforms (like MSVC in VS2010)

* Drop 'full distributable' build, which is replaced by the public GitHub
  repo; simplify Makefiles etc accordingly (this change is not visible in
  the source distributable)

0.10.0 (2014-04-13)
-------------------

* Avoid "out of regs" for large expressions by adding more comprehensive
  register shuffling and indirect variants of several bytecode opcodes

* Change error handler model: error handlers are now set explicitly to
  Duktape.errcreate and Duktape.errthrow, and can interact with both error
  creation and error throwing

* Incompatible API change: errhandler_index argument has been removed
  from all protected API calls as unnecessary

* Add duk_push_heap_stash(), duk_push_global_stash(), and
  duk_push_thread_stash() to provide C code with stashes for storing
  values invisible to ECMAScript code

* Add duk_safe_to_string() and duk_safe_to_lstring() to make it easier
  to write result printing in C

* Add protected variants of eval/compile: duk_peval(), duk_peval_string(),
  duk_peval_file(), duk_pcompile(), duk_pcompile_string(), duk_pcompile_file()

* duk_pcall_prop() now catches invalid stack index errors and property
  lookup errors which happen before the actual call

* Add duk_put_function_list() and duk_put_number_list() to make it easier
  to define modules from C code

* Add Duktape.compact(), Duktape.line(), and Duktape.act()

* Add a "use duk notail" directive which indicates that an ECMAScript
  function should never be tail called

* Add a barebones built-in logging framework with both ECMAScript and C
  APIs and easy customization

* Add a message argument to fatal handler function callback, simplify
  internal fatal error and panic handling

* Compact function templates and instances to reduce memory footprint

* Execute finalizers for all objects, even reachable ones, when a heap
  is freed to allow native resources to be freed reliably

* "new Object()" now promotes plain buffer and pointer values to Buffer
  and Pointer objects

* Buffer values now have virtual numeric index properties and a virtual
  'length' property, so that you can do x = buf[123], buf[123] = x and
  buf.length

* Buffer data areas no longer have an automatic NUL terminator to avoid
  rounding user-requested allocation sizes upwards unnecessarily

* Buffer constructor behavior changes: number argument creates a buffer
  of a certain size; optional second argument indicates whether a buffer
  should be dynamic or fixed

* Change Array.prototype.splice() behavior so that if 2nd argument
  (deleteCount) is not given, splice to end of array instead of treating
  like deleteCount was zero: the new behavior is non-standard but is the
  real world behavior used by V8, Rhino, Spidermonkey, etc

* Add an automatic 'length' property to Duktape/C functions

* Add a feature option to provide a 'caller' property for non-strict
  functions, with behavior similar to the (non-standard) behavior in
  e.g. V8 and Rhino

* Add a feature option to disable automatic zeroing of data areas of
  buffer values

* Improve self tests to include byte order validation

* Allow the global eval() function to be called from C code (causes an
  indirect eval); this was at least an issue with a bound eval() call

* Fix O(depth^2) inner function parsing issue, inner functions are now
  only parsed once and deeply nested inner functions are no longer a
  performance issue

* On platforms requiring a specific alignment, use an alternate object
  property table memory layout to reduce memory footprint

* Wrap remaining platform calls through macro wrappers to allow easier
  targeted fixes if necessary

* Fix a regexp bug: non-capturing groups inside quantifier expressions
  were matched incorrectly

* Fix a regexp bug: capture groups were not reset to 'undefined' when
  a quantified with capture groups was re-matched by a quantifier

* Fix a tail call bug which caused assertion failures when a tail call was
  made from inside a switch-case

* Fix a with statement bug which caused assertion failures when a break or
  continue jumped out of the with statement

* Fix a try-catch-finally broken assertion when finally block had finished
  (ENDFIN opcode)

* Portability fixes for Crossbridge (Flash), NetBSD (endianness detection
  and a few Math.pow() fixes), OpenBSD (endianness detection),
  QNX (endianness and other fixes)

* Warning fixes for non-default feature options and a few exotic compilers

* Duktape can now be compiled with Emscripten and executed with e.g. V8,
  "Dukweb" provides an example where Duktape runs on a web page, with
  Duktape and the browser Javascript environment interacting

0.11.0 (2014-07-11)
-------------------

* Add a built-in module loader (i.e. a require() function) based on CommonJS
  modules v1.1.1; user must always provide a module search function
  (Duktape.modSearch)

* Add Object.setPrototypeOf() and Object.prototype.__proto__, both borrowed
  from ES2015 draft, to improve internal prototype handling

* Add proxy objects borrowed from ES2015 draft to allow property
  virtualization, subset limited to the following traps: has, get, set,
  deleteProperty, enumerate, ownKeys

* Add property name as a non-standard setter/getter argument to make it
  possible to share a single setter/getter pair for multiple properties

* Allow non-standard dollar escape inside character classes (previously
  they were already allowed elsewhere), to support non-standard regexps
  like /[\\$]/

* Add debug API calls to dump the stack top and values in the current context,
  see e.g. duk_dump_context_stdout

* Add convenience API calls: duk_push_uint(), duk_get_global_string()

* Add more variants for eval/compile (such as duk_eval_lstring() and
  duk_compile_lstring()) and avoid interning the source code when compiling
  from a user provided string (useful in low memory environments)

* Add duk_copy() API call, essentially shorthand for duk_dup() + duk_replace()

* Align duk_to_fixed_buffer() arguments and return value with duk_to_buffer()
  (this is an API incompatible change); add duk_to_dynamic_buffer()

* Implement the DUK_COMPILE_FUNCTION flag for duk_compile()

* Remove Duktape.line() as redundant to Duktape.act()

* Serialize negative zero as '-0' in JSONX and JSONC

* Public API C typing wrapped behind typedefs to allow porting to more exotic
  platforms, e.g. platforms where "int" is a 16-bit type; API docs updated to
  describe how type wrapping affects calling code (see new section "C types")

* Internal C typing wrapped throughout to allow porting to more exotic
  platforms, e.g. platforms where "int" is a 16-bit type

* Rename some feature options (DUK_OPT_xxx) for consistency, please check
  any options you use against the up-to-date options list

* Rename Duktape.errcreate and Duktape.errthrow to Duktape.errCreate and
  Duktape.errThrow for naming consistency

* Rename Duktape's custom JSONX format to avoid confusion with JSONx
  (XML encoding for JSON); new names are JX and JC ('jx' and 'jc' in APIs,
  DUK_OPT_NO_JX and DUK_OPT_NO_JC in feature options)

* Compact the automatic function .prototype property, which previously had
  1 unused property slot

* Use 'anon' instead of 'empty' for the function name in toString() coercion
  of an anonymous function, matching traceback behavior

* The expressions !0 and !1 are now constant folded by the compiler as they're
  often found in minified code; also !true and !false are constant folded

* Remove the 256 character limitation for duk_log(), log messages can now be
  arbitrarily long but short messages (<= 256) are still formatted efficiently
  using a stack buffer

* Improve non-C99 build: type detection should now work on (some) 64-bit
  platforms too, and non-debug build should now generate much fewer (or no)
  warnings; this also improves C++ build

* Add support for X32 ABI (gcc -mx32 option)

* Move platform and feature detection into duktape.h, also for internal
  types, which allows type wrappers to be applied to the public API

* Add a safety limit for compiled bytecode byte size and maximum line number
  used to ensure pc-to-line internal data structure limits are not exceeded

* Fix a number conversion related incorrect assertion triggered by the
  test262 test suite

* Fix JSON.parse() handling for '__proto__' named own property, which
  should be parsed as a normal property of that name instead of changing
  the object's prototype

* Fix a duk_push_sprintf() bug: for long formatted strings Duktape would
  reuse a va_list without copying it, which lead to memory unsafe behavior

* Fix a 'delete' bug: if delete target was a string and key was 'length' or
  a valid character index, value stack was left in an inconsistent state in
  non-strict mode (caused an assertion failure)

* Fix a rare math optimization issue in the Date built-in, which caused a
  corner case test (test-bi-date-canceling.js) to fail on e.g. 64-bit Ubuntu,
  gcc 4.8.1, -m32, and no -std=c99

* Fix a few corner case pointer wrapping bugs in duk_set_top() and a few
  other value stack index handling functions

* Portability fix for avoiding potentially non-portable signed integer
  constants internally (e.g. use 0x7fffffffL - 1L instead of -0x80000000L);
  this fixed a concrete problem with at least VS2010 + x64

* Portability fix for avoiding direct function pointers to built-in functions
  (especially math functions) because they may be implemented as inline
  functions or macros on some platforms or polyfill headers

* Portability fixes for MSVC, avoid secure CRT warnings to work better with
  Windows Store apps

* Portability fixes for VS2010, avoid ending up with a packed value
  representation on x64 when standard integer headers are not available
  (also added a self test to catch such cases)

* Reduce warnings generated by /Wp64 option of VS2010 when compiling for
  x86; the remainings warnings are harmless and cannot be completely removed,
  see guide documentation for more information

* Portability fix for DUK_OPT_SEGFAULT_ON_PANIC when C99 types are not
  available

* Portability fixes for uclibc, use a replacement for e.g. fpclassify()
  because it is broken in some uclibc versions still in use (affected at
  least some mixed endian ARM environments)

* Portability fixes for newer Emscripten version, Dukweb.js now works with
  Firefox

* A few polyfills for non-standard but still commonly used features are
  provided in the distributable polyfills/ directory

* AUTHORS.txt is now included in the distributable, and both LICENSE.txt and
  AUTHORS.txt are embedded into duktape.c and duktape.h to ensure they're
  automatically included when used in another project

0.12.0 (2014-09-26)
-------------------

* Beta release for stabilization: feature freeze until 1.0.0 release, most
  work will be testing, bug fixes, and documentation

* Remove undocumented duk_xmove(), add duk_xmove_top() and duk_xcopy_top()
  (duk_xcopy_top() provides the same semantics as the earlier undocumented
  duk_xmove())

* Change strictness behavior for Duktape API calls: all API calls now have
  ECMAScript strict semantics, even when a call is made with an empty call
  stack outside of any Duktape/C function

* Change strictness handling of duk_eval() and variants so that all code is
  evaluated in non-strict mode by default (unless the code itself contains
  a "use strict" directive); without this change the strictness would depend
  on whether a Duktape/C function call was active or not

* Change Array.prototype.concat() and Array.prototype.map() behavior so that
  trailing non-existent elements are counted towards the result array length;
  this behavior seems to be non-standard but is the real world behavior used
  by V8, Rhino, and Spidermonkey at least

* Add API call duk_set_global_object() which allows the global object of a
  context to be replaced; this is useful as an initial mechanism for proper
  sandboxing of ECMAScript code

* Add API calls duk_get_prototype() and duk_set_prototype() for getting and
  setting an object's "internal prototype" from C code

* Add API calls duk_get_finalizer() and duk_set_finalizer() for getting and
  setting an object's finalizer from C code

* Add API calls for function "magic" which allows a 16-bit signed integer
  to be associated (cheaply) with a Duktape/C function

* Treat any strings whose byte representation begins with 0xFF as internal,
  so that user code can use hidden internal properties like Duktape does
  internally; such properties are not enumerated or returned by e.g.
  getOwnPropertyNames()

* Fix the object property allocation resizing algorithm to avoid unbounded
  memory usage with some insert/delete sequences
  (see test-bug-object-prop-alloc-unbounded.js)

* Use an equivalent year (matching leap-year-ness and weekday of Jan 1) for
  local tzoffset calculations outside the [1971,2037] year range to improve
  local time handling

* Use gmtime() + localtime() on Unix (instead of gmtime() twice) for local
  tzoffset, fixing some DST cases

* Improve parsing of a local time (new Date(2012, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) using an
  iterative algorithm to get a more accurate tzoffset/DST estimate

* Apply E5.1 Section 15.3.5.4 TypeError throwing also when the property value
  is a bound strict function, previously the special "caller" property
  behavior was only applied when "caller" value was a non-bound strict mode
  function

* Reject deletion of plain buffer indexed elements (previously this behavior
  was implemented only for Buffer objects), i.e. delete returns false (in
  non-strict functions) or throws a TypeError (in strict functions)

* Reject empty throw statement ('throw;') and reject a newline which occurs
  between a 'throw' and its argument

* Disable internal interrupt mechanism in anticipation of 1.0 release since
  there will be no API to use it

* Fix value stack reserve handling for function calls: a function call
  (ECMAScript or Duktape/C) might reduce the valstack "checked size" which
  was previously requested by user code (for more detail, see API test case
  test-dev-valstack-checked-size-call.c)

* Fix finalizer handling for Proxy objects: if a Proxy object was reachable
  at heap destruction and the target object had a finalizer, the finalizer
  would also be executed for the Proxy object

* Fix a few Date bugs for large out-of-range years which caused some assert
  failures and incorrect behavior when year was out of ECMAScript range (e.g.
  year 870e6 and year -200e6)

* Minor compile warnings fixes for non-default options (e.g. when reference
  counting is disabled)

* Make objects and functions defined by included polyfills non-enumerable so
  that they don't enumerate e.g. in a for-in loop

* A few more polyfills

1.0.0 (2014-10-26)
------------------

* Feature complete baseline release

* Add convenience API call: duk_put_global_string()

* Rename duk_is_fixed() to duk_is_fixed_buffer() and duk_is_dynamic() to
  duk_is_dynamic_buffer() for consistency with other API calls

* Rename Duktape internal keys to start with an uppercase character (e.g.
  "\\xFFValue") so that user internal keys which begin with a lowercase
  character (e.g. "\\xFFptr") won't conflict by default

* Add OS and compiler strings to Duktape.env

* Make error 'tracedata' an internal property for better sandboxing

* Rename members of struct duk_memory_functions to have a "_func" suffix,
  to avoid conflicting with standard library names (which is problematic if
  the standard names are #defines)

* Add DUK_OPT_DLL_BUILD, which should be enabled for both Duktape and
  application build when Duktape is built as a DLL; on Windows it makes
  Duktape use __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport) for public
  API symbols

* Rename RELEASES.txt, AUTHORS.txt, and README.txt files to .rst suffix for
  better automatic formatting

* Fix a mark-and-sweep finalizer bug which could cause memory safety issues
  when finalizer execution was disabled for a mark-and-sweep round

* Fix a mark-and-sweep zero-size realloc() bug which could happen when an
  initial zero-size realloc() failed (this shouldn't normally happen but
  was triggered by GC torture testing)

* Fix an assertion failure when using labelled block statements; some
  labelled block statements still cause an internal error ("INVALID
  opcode 0") but don't cause assert failures

* Fix an assertion failure when using a try-catch in a function with a lot
  of constants (more than 511 string or non-integer constants); a compile
  error happens now instead to prevent unsafe behavior

* Fix duk_dump_context_stderr() which incorrectly dumped to stdout

* Fix require() resolution of relative module identifiers, which was off by
  one component (GH-48)

* Fix DUK_INVALID_INDEX define value, it used INT_MIN directly

* Fix return value of Duktape.gc() to return true (instead of false) for
  a successful mark-and-sweep

* Fix duk_peval_file(), duk_peval_file_noresult() and duk_pcompile_file()
  to avoid throwing an error for a missing file

* Fix compile error for DUK_OPT_NO_FILE_IO

* Regexp internal limit errors changed from Error to RangeError

* Change command line example to be "barebones" by default, with readline
  enabled via DUK_CMDLINE_FANCY

* Use variadic macros for VS2005+

1.0.1 (2014-10-31)
------------------

* Fix compile error for DUK_OPT_NO_PC2LINE

* Fix fileName for functions defined in a module loaded using require(),
  previously fileName would always be duk_bi_global.c which is misleading
  (GH-58)

1.0.2 (2014-11-08)
------------------

* Quick fix for C++ compilation issue caused by Duktape using both
  static declaration and a static define which is not allowed in C++;
  the quick fix is to avoid "static" entirely with C++ (GH-63)

1.1.0 (2015-01-09)
------------------

* Main release goal: improved low memory support to allow Duktape to run
  better on devices with 128kB (or even 96kB) system memory; with the changes
  in this release, Duktape initial RAM usage is reduced from about 46kB to
  22kB for a 32-bit target when all low memory features are enabled

* Add lightfunc (DUK_TYPE_LIGHTFUNC) primitive type, representing a
  Duktape/C function with a plain tagged value without any heap allocations

* Add duk_push_c_lightfunc() and duk_is_lightfunc() API calls to push user
  lightfuncs on the value stack and to check if a value is a lightfunc

* Add feature option DUK_OPT_LIGHTFUNC_BUILTINS which causes Duktape to use
  lightfuncs for almost all built-in functions, saving around 14kB of Duktape
  heap on 32-bit platforms

* Add multiple feature options to use 16-bit fields and pointer compression
  for reducing memory usage on low memory systems, see doc/low-memory.rst
  for detailed discussion

* Add DUK_OPT_EXTERNAL_STRINGS to enable support for external strings which
  are like dynamic buffers: a fixed size string header is allocated from the
  Duktape heap, but the data is behind a pointer

* Add DUK_OPT_EXTSTR_INTERN_CHECK and DUK_OPT_EXTSTR_FREE (used with
  DUK_OPT_EXTERNAL_STRINGS) to allow string data to be held outside the
  Duktape heap, which is useful in low memory environments; see
  doc/low-memory.rst for detailed discussion

* Add DUK_OPT_STRTAB_CHAIN and DUK_OPT_STRTAB_CHAIN_SIZE=nnn which enable
  an alternate string table algorithm intended for low memory environments;
  the algorithm uses separate chaining with arrays, making allocation
  behavior easier to handle using a pool allocator, see doc/low-memory.rst

* Add duk_def_prop() which allows creation of accessor (getter/setter)
  properties and other custom properties from C code (instead of using
  Object.defineProperty() from ECMAScript code)

* Add duk_is_error() API call to check if a value inherits from Error

* Add duk_get_error_code() API call to check if a value inherits from
  Error, and if so, map its error class to DUK_ERR_xxx codes so that
  checking for built-in errors is more convenient

* Add duk_get_heapptr(), duk_require_heapptr(), and duk_push_heapptr()
  to get borrowed void pointer references to Duktape heap objects
  (objects, strings, buffers)

* Add vararg variants duk_error_va(), duk_push_error_object_va(), and
  duk_log_va()

* Add DUK_GIT_DESCRIBE macro to the C API (with no ECMAScript equivalent)
  to allow application code to e.g. log more detailed version information
  relevant for non-official snapshot builds

* Add feature option DUK_OPT_NO_STRICT_DECL to disable support for "use
  strict" declarations which may be useful with legacy code bases

* Add DUK_OPT_SETJMP, DUK_OPT_UNDERSCORE_SETJMP, and DUK_OPT_SIGSETJMP to
  force an alternative provider for long control transfers; _setjmp() or
  sigsetjmp() (with savesigs set to 0) can be a lot faster than setjmp()
  if the platform's setjmp() implementation saves the signal mask (GH-55)

* Default to _setjmp() for long control transfers on OSX/iPhone (when
  __APPLE__ is defined) (GH-55)

* Add SuperH detection support

* Change JSON.stringify() to escape U+2028 and U+2029 by default to make
  the output a valid Javascript string, so that it can be embedded in a
  web page or parsed with eval (GH-68)

* Change JSON.parse() to include a byte offset with a syntax error to help
  pinpoint JSON errors

* Make Function.prototype.name writable so that application code can set
  a 'name' property on Duktape/C functions (GH-79)

* Change buffer maximum size check to compare against allocated size
  (including spare) instead of requested size (without spare), this has
  a practical impact only when using 16-bit buffer size field

* Use deep C stack for dukweb.js to remove some compiler recursion limit
  limitations (GH-67)

* Add an example allocator with alloc/realloc/free logging, which is
  useful when optimizing e.g. pool sizes for low memory targets

* Add an example allocator with memory wiping, red zones for invalid
  writes, and forced address change on realloc, which can be used for
  detecting memory safety issues on platforms where valgrind is not
  available

* Add an example allocator with a hybrid model where a fixed set of small
  pools are used to reduce allocator churn, but the allocator falls back
  to malloc, realloc, and free for larger allocation sizes or when there
  are no free pool entries

* Add an SPDX 1.2 license into the distributable

* Fix INVALID opcode error for some labelled non-iteration statements
  (GH-85)

* Fix a few missing "volatile" attributes in the bytecode executor which
  affected setjmp handling in clang (especially for _setjmp and sigsetjmp),
  also fix a few setjmp clobber warnings in executor

* Fix compile error for DUK_OPT_NO_PC2LINE

* Better fix for C++ compilation issue caused by Duktape using both
  static declaration and a static define which is not allowed in C++
  (GH-63)

* Fix compiler specific behavior when assigning a string to a buffer index
  (e.g. buf[3] = 'x'), now NaN coerces consistently to zero (this was the
  behavior on most compilers but e.g. on Linux MIPS NaN coerced to 255)

* Fix fileName for functions defined in a module loaded using require(),
  previously fileName would always be duk_bi_global.c which is misleading
  (GH-58)

* Fix object literal getter/setter definition to avoid creating a binding
  for the function (property) name, so that a setter/getter can access an
  outside variable with the same name as the get/set property (see
  test-bug-getset-func-name.js for details)

* Fix JSON.parse() syntax error for explicitly positive exponents (e.g.
  '1.5e+2') (GH-93)

* Fix duk_push_error_object() return value for platforms where variadic
  macros are not available

* Don't fail compilation if SIZE_MAX is < 0xffffffffUL, to allow compilation
  on platforms where SIZE_MAX is (apparently) incorrectly defined

* Fix several compile warnings with gcc 4.9.2 (GH-91)

* Fix MinGW and Cygwin GCC compile warning "visibility attribute not
  supported in this configuration; ignored" when using separate sources

* Fix MSVC const difference warning

* Fix <inttypes.h> issue for older C++ compilers by defining
  __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS and __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS before including
  stdint.h and inttypes.h

* Fix various warnings and errors detected in option matrix testing

------------------

* Fix Unicode handling of CJK ideographs and Hangul which were incorrectly

  body was not checked and Duktape would accept e.g. "function () [}"
  (GH-106)

  necessary, fixing "CSPROPI target is not a number" error (GH-115)

* Fix value stack setup bug which caused a segfault with large number of

  "a[i] = b[i++]" (GH-118)

* Fix incorrect parsing of zero escape in regexp class ("[\\0]") (GH-122)

* Fix tail call issue in return comma expression when a function call
  in the comma expression was followed by a constant value or a register
  bound variable, e.g. 'return 0, (function { return 1; })(), 2;' would
  return 1 instead of 2 (GH-131)

* Fix for-in statement shuffle bug which caused enumeration to fail
  in large functions which enable register shuffling (GH-132)

* Fix shuffle handling issue for PUTPROP opcode, discovered by shuffle
  torture tests (GH-135)

1.1.3 (2015-04-03)

  in a switch statement (GH-155)

* Fix a few compiler warnings (GH-141)

1.2.0 (2015-04-05)
------------------

* Main release goals: debugger support and performance improvements

* Add first iteration of experimental debugger support which is based on a
  narrow debug API and a standard debug protocol; Duktape also provides an
  example debug client with a web UI, and a JSON debug proxy

* Add support "fastints", i.e. for using integer arithmetic when possible
  in a transparent manner (improves performance for some workloads on soft
  float and some hard float platforms)

* Add DUK_OPT_EXEC_TIMEOUT_CHECK(), an experimental bytecode execution timeout
  mechanism to safely bail out if script execution takes too long; this
  protects against accidental errors but is not (yet) intended to protect
  against deliberately malicious code

* Internal performance improvement: direct refcount manipulation from macros
  instead of doing a helper function call

* Internal performance improvement: hex encode/decode optimizations

* Internal performance improvement: shorter internal chain for API push
  functions like duk_push_undefined()

* Performance improvement: array write fast path when writing to "dense"
  Array instances using a numeric index

* Add internal type tag to Duktape.info() result for non-heap-allocated types
  (useful for some testing)

* Accept 32-bit codepoints in String.fromCharCode() to better support non-BMP
  strings (GH-120)

* Make RegExp compiler/executor C stack limit higher on mainstream platforms
  (GH-157)

* Add source code fileName/lineNumber to errors thrown during compilation
  (GH-140)

* Improve MIPS32/MIPS64 detection, architecture strings in Duktape.env
  also updated ("mips32" or "mips64") (GH-102)

* Add iPhone/iOS strings to Duktape.env

* Add support for TI-Nspire (using Ndless, see GH-113)

* Fix Unicode handling of CJK ideographs and Hangul which were incorrectly

  body was not checked and Duktape would accept e.g. "function () [}"
  (GH-106)

* Fix compiler register limit bug where an ECMAScript function with
  [65536,262143] VM registers would be compiled into incorrect bytecode
  instead of being rejected with an internal error (GH-111)

* Fix buffer assignment to allow negative values: buf[3] = -1 now yields 0xFF
  (in Duktape 1.1 yields 0x00 because negative values are capped to 0)

* Fix compiler shuffle register handling by doing a pass 3 compile if
  necessary, fixing "CSPROPI target is not a number" error (GH-115)

* Fix value stack setup bug which caused a segfault with large number of
  arguments (GH-107)

* Fix assignment evaluation order issue which affected expressions like
  "a[i] = b[i++]" (GH-118)

  in the comma expression was followed by a constant value or a register
  bound variable, e.g. 'return 0, (function { return 1; })(), 2;' would
  return 1 instead of 2 (GH-131)

* Fix for-in statement shuffle bug which caused enumeration to fail
  in large functions which enable register shuffling (GH-132)

  torture tests (GH-135)

* Fix a potential crash risk in Duktape.info() caused by a live pointer being
  used across a possible realloc

* Fix Duktape.act() lineNumber bug, PC used for lineNumber was off-by-one
  which sometimes resulted in incorrect linenumbers (GH-143)

* Fix incorrect switch-case matching when default clause is the first clause
  in a switch statement (GH-155)

* Fix a few compiler warnings (GH-141)

1.2.1 (2015-04-08)
------------------

* Fix duk_push_nan() NaN normalization bug which caused segfaults when using
  MSVC on x86 and potentially on other 32-bit platforms (GH-168)

1.2.2 (2015-06-02)
------------------

* Fix harmless MSVC warnings when using DUK_OPT_FASTINT on x86 (GH-172)

* Fix compile error from array fast path when using low memory options
  (GH-174)

* Fix harmless MSVC warnings for size_t casts on x64 (GH-177)

* Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in duk_is_dynamic_buffer() and

------------------

* Fix bytecode execution timeout regression which caused timeouts to fail
  after the first execution timeout had been triggered (GH-212)

* Fix a few pointer compression issues (DUK_OPT_HEAPPTR16 / DUK_USE_HEAPPTR16)
  on 64-bit platforms (GH-228)

* Fix JX parsing bug which caused strings like "1Infinity" to be parsed as
  negative infinity instead of causing a SyntaxError (GH-247)

* Fix accidental ToString(this) coercion in Error.prototype.fileName and
  Error.prototype.lineNumber which was an issue if you replaced
  Error.prototype.toString with a function that accessed the 'lineNumber'
  or 'fileName' property of the error (GH-254)

1.2.4 (2015-09-06)
------------------

* Fix a try-finally finalizer side effect issue by scrubbing TRYCATCH catch
  registers before executing the try code block (GH-287)

* Fix missing activation lookup from call handling after an Arguments object
  was created, this could in theory lead to memory unsafe behavior (GH-305)

* Avoid including <windows.h> for application build (GH-312)

1.2.5 (2015-11-23)
------------------

* Fix duk_is_primitive() return value for invalid index, was incorrectly 1
  (GH-337)

* Fix assignment expression handling of the right-hand-side value when that
  value is a register-bound variable which is used and mutated in the rest
  of the expression (GH-381)

* Remove octal autodetection in parseInt(), also fixes incorrect octal
  autodetection in e.g. "parseInt('00e1', 16)" (GH-413, GH-414)

* Fix a bug in number conversion resolving a few (but not all) corner case
  rounding issues (GH-264)

* Fix a segfault (and assertion error) caused by compiler intermediate value
  handling bug; the bug was triggered when a temporary register was required
  by the compiler, but an existing "intermediate value" referred to a const
  instead of a register value (GH-449)

1.2.6 (2016-04-19)
------------------

* Fix potentially memory unsafe behavior when a refcount-triggered finalizer
  function rescues an object; the memory unsafe behavior doesn't happen
  immediately which makes the cause of the unsafe behavior difficult to
  diagnose (GH-531)

* Fix debugger detach handling bug which could cause the debugger to be
  re-entered recursively during detach handling; this could cause various
  difficult to diagnose side effects (GH-599, GH-597, GH-591)

1.3.0 (2015-09-12)
------------------

* Introduce an external duk_config.h header which provides all platform and
  configuration specific defines; this makes it easier to adapt Duktape to
  custom platforms (GH-64)

* Add support for Node.js Buffer API (GH-152)

* Add support for Khronos/ES2015 TypedArray API (subset of ES2015 API) (GH-151)

* Add duk_push_external_buffer(), duk_is_external_buffer(), and
  duk_config_buffer() which provide support for external buffers, i.e. buffer
  values which point to a user memory area allocated outside of Duktape heap
  (for example, an externally allocated frame buffer) (GH-153)

* Add duk_push_buffer_object() which allows pushing of all buffer object and
  buffer view types (GH-190)

* Add duk_get_buffer_data() and duk_require_buffer_data() API calls which
  accept both plain buffer and buffer object values (GH-190)

* Add duk_steal_buffer() API call which allows user code to steal the current
  allocation of a dynamic buffer which is useful for some buffer manipulation
  algorithms (GH-129)

* Add support for module.exports in the module loader framework (GH-201)

* Change Duktape.modLoaded[] module cache to track the "module" object
  instead of the "exports" value to better support module.exports and
  circular dependencies

* Change debugger breakpoint behavior to trigger only if the exact breakpoint
  line is reached to avoid unintuitive breakpoint behavior when breakpoints
  are in conditional blocks which are skipped entirely (GH-263)

* Improve Emscripten compatibility as a result of TypedArray support:
  Emscripten fastcomp can now be used and Duktape can run more complex
  Emscripten-compiled programs (e.g. Lua or Duktape itself)

* Internal performance improvement: add a fast path for JSON.stringify(),
  active when no replacer and no indent used; fast path is not enabled
  by default because it makes some non-portable type assumptions (GH-204)

* Minor change to plain buffer and Duktape.Buffer write coercion for
  consistency with Node.js Buffer and TypeArray, e.g. -Infinity now
  coerces to 0x00 rather than 0xFF

* Add support for an external date/time provider to make porting the Date
  built-in to exotic platforms easier

* Add duk_dump_function() and duk_load_function() API calls which provide
  bytecode dump/load support (GH-27)

* Add duk_pnew() API call (GH-124)

* Add duk_instanceof() API call (GH-148)

* Add Proxy object support to 'instanceof' operator (without support for
  'getPrototypeOf' trap) (GH-182)

* Add explicit 'this' binding for C eval calls so that strict eval code also
  gets 'this' bound to the global object (GH-164)

* Change typing of "duk_context" from "void" to "struct duk_hthread" which
  should improve compiler warnings/errors when accidentally passing an invalid
  "ctx" pointer to a Duktape API call (GH-178)

* Add internal assertions for validating the "ctx" pointer beyond just a NULL
  check (GH-178)

* Add platform detection support for AmigaOS on PowerPC (GH-269)

* Internal performance improvement: improve bytecode opcode dispatch
  performance (GH-265, GH-294)

* Internal performance improvement: improve bytecode executor constant
  lookups (GH-295)

* Internal performance improvement: improve lexer tokenization (GH-207)

* Internal performance improvement: add several fast paths to JSON parse
  and stringify; remove explicit end-of-input check from JSON parsing
  relying on (guaranteed) NUL termination instead (GH-139, GH-209)

* Internal performance improvements from removing dynamic buffer spare:
  small improvements to lexer, compiler bytecode emission, JSON parse() and
  stringify(), duk_map_string(), global object escape(), unescape() and
  variants, regexp compilation, string case conversion, and a few other
  places (GH-209)

* Sizeof(duk_hbuffer_dynamic) reduced from 16 to 12 bytes for low memory
  builds which employ heap compression (GH-209)

* Increase try-catch register limit (from 511 to 262143) to fix try-catch
  out-of-register issues for most code (GH-145)

* Remove DUK_OPT_DEEP_C_STACK (and DUK_USE_DEEP_C_STACK) in favor of explicit
  DUK_USE_xxx config options for native recursion limits; C stacks are assumed
  to be deep by default for all targets including OSX/iPhone (GH-165, GH-226)

* Make Proxy internal _Target and _Handler properties immutable (non-writable
  and non-configurable) (GH-237)

* Remove internal support for dynamic buffer spare; improves performance a
  bit, reduces duk_hbuffer_dynamic footprint for both normal and low memory
  header (GH-209)

* Incompatible change to debugger DumpHeap command format: dynamic buffer
  alloc size is no long sent because it was removed from the internal data
  structure (GH-209)

* Add example debug transport with local dvalue encoding and decoding, also
  provides a C example for encoding and decoding dvalues (GH-251)

* Provide at least 10 callstack entries for error handling (Duktape.errCreate)
  when callstack limit is reached (GH-191)

* Fix a try-finally finalizer side effect issue by scrubbing TRYCATCH catch
  registers before executing the try code block (GH-287)

* Fix missing activation lookup from call handling after an Arguments object
  was created, this could in theory lead to memory unsafe behavior (GH-305)

* Fix debugger GetCallStack line number handling for callstack entries below
  the callstack top (GH-281)

* Fix debugger breakpoint/pause check when a function call is caused by a side
  effect like a property getter call (GH-303)

* Fix object environment handling to allow Proxy object as a binding
  target, so that a Proxy can be used in a with statement or as the
  duk_set_global_object() argument (GH-221)

* Fix accidental ToString(this) coercion in Error.prototype.fileName and
  Error.prototype.lineNumber which was an issue if you replaced
  Error.prototype.toString with a function that accessed the 'lineNumber'
  or 'fileName' property of the error (GH-254)

* Fix bytecode execution timeout regression which caused timeouts to fail
  after the first execution timeout had been triggered (GH-212)

* Fix some corner cases in execution timeout handling which caused some
  timeouts to be missed (GH-214)

* Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in duk_is_dynamic_buffer() and
  duk_is_fixed_buffer() when index is outside of value stack (GH-206)

* Fix duk_push_nan() NaN normalization bug which caused segfaults when using
  MSVC on x86 and potentially on other 32-bit platforms (GH-168)

* Fix JX parsing bug which caused strings like "1Infinity" to be parsed as
  negative infinity instead of causing a SyntaxError (GH-247)

* Fix duk_is_primitive() return value for invalid index, was incorrectly 1
  (GH-337)

* Fix compile error from array fast path when using low memory options
  (GH-174)

* Fix a few pointer compression issues (DUK_OPT_HEAPPTR16 / DUK_USE_HEAPPTR16)
  on 64-bit platforms (GH-228)

* Fix a bug in number conversion resolving a few (but not all) corner case
  rounding issues (GH-264)

* Fix IAR Compiler compilation error caused by volatiles in argument list
  (GH-318)

* Fix harmless MSVC warnings when using DUK_OPT_FASTINT on x86 (GH-172)

* Fix harmless MSVC warnings for size_t casts on x64 (GH-177)

* Avoid including <windows.h> for application build (GH-312)

1.3.1 (2015-11-27)
------------------

* Fix assignment expression handling of the right-hand-side value when that
  value is a register-bound variable which is used and mutated in the rest
  of the expression (GH-381)

* Fix nested property assignment handling (GH-427, GH-428)

* Fix property access expression handling when a variable holding the base
  value is mutated by other parts of the expression, in both LHS and RHS
  positions (GH-429)

* Remove octal autodetection in parseInt(), also fixes incorrect octal
  autodetection in e.g. "parseInt('00e1', 16)" (GH-413, GH-414)

* Fix a segfault (and assertion error) caused by compiler intermediate value
  handling bug; the bug was triggered when a temporary register was required
  by the compiler, but an existing "intermediate value" referred to a const
  instead of a register value (GH-449)

1.3.2 (2016-01-11)
------------------

* Fix segfault (assertion failure when asserts enabled) in
  String.prototype.replace() when match argument is RegExp.prototype
  (GH-492, GH-495)

* Fix a bogus trailing semicolon in the duk_push_buffer() API macro which
  caused compilation errors if duk_push_buffer() was e.g. part of a comma
  expression (GH-500, GH-501)

1.3.3 (2016-04-17)
------------------

* Fix potentially memory unsafe behavior when a refcount-triggered finalizer
  function rescues an object; the memory unsafe behavior doesn't happen
  immediately which makes the cause of the unsafe behavior difficult to
  diagnose (GH-531)

* Fix memory unsafe behavior when an external plain buffer was allocated
  with heap pointer compression enabled (DUK_USE_HEAPPTR16) (GH-618)

1.4.0 (2016-01-10)
------------------

* Add support for using C++ exceptions instead of setjmp()/longjmp() to
  propagate errors inside Duktape, enabled using DUK_OPT_CPP_EXCEPTIONS
  (DUK_USE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS); this change allows C++ code to use scope-based
  resource management (automatic destructor calls) in Duktape/C functions
  with the cleanup code executing on errors (GH-63, GH-75, GH-499)

* Add minimal support for "const" declarations with non-standard semantics,
  intended mainly for minimal compatibility with existing code using "const"
  (GH-360)

* Add a human readable summary of object/key for rejected property operations
  and function calls to make error messages more useful for expressions like
  "null.foo = 123" and "null()" (GH-210, GH-405, GH-417)

* Add a debugger Throw notify for errors about to be thrown, and an option
  to automatically pause before an uncaught error is thrown (GH-286, GH-347)

* Add a debugger Detaching notify which informs a debug client of an orderly
  (or non-orderly) pending detach (GH-423, GH-430, GH-434)

* Allow debugger detached callback to call duk_debugger_attach(), previously
  this clobbered some internal state (GH-399)

* Add defines DUK_DEFPROP_{SET,CLEAR}_{WRITABLE,ENUMERABLE,CONFIGURABLE} for
  duk_def_prop() to improve call site readability (GH-421)

* Add convenience API calls to detect specific error subtypes, e.g.
  duk_is_eval_error() (GH-340, GH-433)

* Make Error instance .filename, .lineNumber, and .stack directly writable
  to match V8 and Spidermonkey behavior; the previous behavior is provided
  by polyfills/duktape-error-setter-nonwritable.js (GH-390)

* Accept a plain buffer in typed array constructors with same behavior as
  for Duktape.Buffer arguments (use as a value initializer) (GH-484)

* Zero buffer data in ArrayBuffer and typed array constructors even when
  DUK_USE_ZERO_BUFFER_DATA is not set (default is set) to respect explicit
  zeroing guarantee of Khronos/ES2015 (GH-484)

* Add duk_require_function() and duk_require_callable() (GH-441)

* Improve error message verbosity for API index check calls, duk_require_xxx()
  calls, and Array iterator calls (GH-441)

* Improve error object .fileName and .lineNumber attribution: if a callstack
  function is missing a .fileName property, scan the callstack until a
  function with a .fileName is found which improves error reporting for e.g.
  "[1,2,3].forEach(null)" (GH-455)

* Provide a stronger finalizer re-entry guarantee than before: a finalizer
  is called exactly once (at the latest in heap destruction) unless the
  target object is rescued, in which case the finalizer is called once per
  "rescue cycle" (GH-473)

* Better finalizer behavior for heap destruction: finalized objects may
  create new finalizable objects whose finalizers will also be called
  (GH-473)

* Add a second argument to finalizer calls, a boolean value which is true
  when the finalizer is called during heap destruction as part of forced
  finalization; the finalized object cannot be rescued by the finalizer
  in such cases (GH-473)

* Add a combined duktape.c without #line directives into the dist package,
  as it is a useful alternative in some environments (GH-363)

* Add a short term workaround for case sensitive RegExp performance using a
  128kB canonicalization lookup table; the workaround is disabled by default
  because of the relatively large code footprint, enable using
  DUK_OPT_REGEXP_CANON_WORKAROUND or DUK_USE_REGEXP_CANON_WORKAROUND if
  editing duk_config.h directly (GH-411)

* Add a fastint downgrade check for yield/resume values (GH-482)

* Improve error message for source code UTF-8 decode error (GH-504, GH-506)

* Fix a segfault (and assertion error) caused by compiler intermediate value
  handling bug; the bug was triggered when a temporary register was required
  by the compiler, but an existing "intermediate value" referred to a const
  instead of a register value (GH-449)

* Fix compile warnings for gcc/clang -Wcast-qual (GH-426)

* Fix "debugger" statement line number off-by-one so that the debugger now
  correctly pauses on the debugger statement rather than after it (GH-347)

* Fix assignment expression handling of the right-hand-side value when that
  value is a register-bound variable which is used and mutated in the rest
  of the expression (GH-381)

* Fix nested property assignment handling (GH-427, GH-428)

* Fix property access expression handling when a variable holding the base
  value is mutated by other parts of the expression, in both LHS and RHS
  positions (GH-429)

* Fix Unix local time offset handling which caused issues at least on RISC
  OS (GH-406, GH-407)

* Fix a bug in stack trace ellipsis ("[...]") handling: previously the
  ellipsis might be emitted up to 2 callstack levels too early because
  the presence of a compilation error and/or a C call site was not taken
  into account in stack trace creation (GH-455)

* Fix a bogus trailing semicolon in the duk_push_buffer() API macro which
  caused compilation errors if duk_push_buffer() was e.g. part of a comma
  expression (GH-500, GH-501)

* Fix segfault (assertion failure when asserts enabled) in
  String.prototype.replace() when match argument is RegExp.prototype
  (GH-492, GH-495)

* Remove octal autodetection in parseInt(), also fixes incorrect octal
  autodetection in e.g. "parseInt('00e1', 16)" (GH-413, GH-414)

* Fix base64 decode reject for whitespace between padding characters
  (e.g. "Zm= =") (GH-465)

* Internal performance improvement: rework RETURN opcode handling to avoid
  longjmp() calls, improving performance slightly on ordinary platforms and
  significantly on Emscripten (GH-342, GH-345)

* Internal performance improvement: rework BREAK and CONTINUE opcode handling
  to avoid longjmp() calls, improving performance slightly on ordinary
  platforms and significantly on Emscripten (GH-348)

* Internal performance improvement: improve bytecode emitted when compiling
  assignment statements with an identifier left-hand-side value, especially
  when the assignment is a top level expression like "x = y + z;" (GH-380)

* Internal performance improvement: split bytecode executor and call handling
  into an inner and outer function, with the outer function containing a
  setjmp/longjmp catch point and the inner function free of setjmp/longjmp
  (GH-369, GH-370, GH-498)

* Internal performance improvement: change value stack initialization policy
  so that values above current value stack top are set to "undefined" instead
  of "unused" to improve call performance (GH-389)

* Internal performance improvement: use a separate 'unused' tag instead of a
  sub-type of 'undefined' to e.g. mark gaps in arrays (GH-396)

* Internal performance improvement: rework "effective this" handling for
  better call performance (GH-397)

* Internal performance improvement: improve duk_push_this() performance by
  direct value stack access (GH-403)

* Internal performance improvement: faster computation of string UTF-8
  character length in string interning (GH-422)

* Internal performance improvement: change default internal string hash
  algorithm to a faster algorithm adapted from Lua/djb2 hash, with the
  previous algorithm (based on Murmurhash2) available using a config
  option (GH-139, GH-432)

* Internal performance improvement: optimize internal refcount handling
  macros (GH-394)

* Internal performance improvement: improve JSON.stringify() slow path
  indentation and loop detection performance (GH-444, GH-446)

* Internal performance improvement: improve JSON.stringify() fast path
  by allowing indent value or gap string and by supporting JX/JC in the
  fast path (GH-445)

* Internal performance improvement: add fast paths for hex and base64
  encoding/decoding (GH-465, GH-467, GH-471)

1.4.1 (2016-04-19)
------------------

* Fix potentially memory unsafe behavior when a refcount-triggered finalizer
  function rescues an object; the memory unsafe behavior doesn't happen
  immediately which makes the cause of the unsafe behavior difficult to
  diagnose (GH-531)

* Fix a genconfig legacy feature option bug in Duktape 1.4.0 which caused
  DUK_USE_PACKED_TVAL to default to false unless forced using
  DUK_OPT_PACKED_TVAL (GH-550)

* Fix debugger Eval handling issue where an uncaught error during Eval
  command (with "pause on uncaught" option enabled) would cause a recursive
  attempt to halt execution (GH-558, GH-562)

* Fix debugger detach handling bug which could cause the debugger to be
  re-entered recursively during detach handling; this could cause various
  difficult to diagnose side effects (GH-599, GH-597, GH-591)

* Fix debugger detach handling bug which could cause detach handling to be
  initiated but not completed if the debug transport write error occurred
  outside of the debugger message loop (for example when writing a Status
  notify in running state) (GH-599, GH-597, GH-591)

* Fix debugger transport write error bug which could cause Duktape to call
  the debug transport write callback after it had already returned an error
  (GH-599)

* Fix memory unsafe behavior when an external plain buffer was allocated
  with heap pointer compression enabled (DUK_USE_HEAPPTR16) (GH-618)

1.4.2 (2016-08-29)
------------------

* Fix potential memory unsafe behavior when duk_push_(l)string() data pointer
  is from a dynamic/external buffer (or any other relocatable data source)
  and a finalizer side effect resizes/reconfigures the buffer, invalidating
  the pointer before string table code has time to copy the data (GH-884)

1.5.0 (2016-05-03)
------------------

* Add support for placing Duktape and user strings and objects into ROM
  (read-only data section) which reduces the startup RAM usage of a low
  memory build to ~3kB (from ~27kB) (GH-559)

* Add debugger heap object inspection commands GetHeapObjInfo, GetObjPropDesc,
  and GetObjPropDescRange, which allow a debug client to inspect heap objects
  in detail, walk prototype chains, etc (GH-358, GH-617)

* Garbage collection is now automatically disabled when execution is paused
  in the debugger, which facilitates safe heap walking (GH-617)

* Add a config option to drop the 16-bit character length field from
  duk_hstring to reduce duk_hstring header overhead from 12 to 8 bytes,
  which reduces low memory startup size using default RAM-based built-ins
  from 27kB to 24kB (GH-642)

* Allow ES2015 unescaped curly braces ('{' and '}') in regular expressions
  (non-standard before ES2015 Annex B) when no valid quantifier can be parsed;
  this improves compatibility with existing Javascript code which often
  assumes support for literal curly braces (GH-142, GH-513, GH-547, GH-565)

* Change Function object .toString() output to be Emscripten compatible:
  anonymous functions won't get an automatic "anon" name, and the function
  type is indicated using a fake directive rather than a comment; for example,
  'function () {"ecmascript"}' (GH-554)

* Make .stack format a bit more user friendly; if you are parsing the stack
  trace format this may need changes in your parser (GH-588, GH-592)

* Change automatic filename of compiled functions and eval code from
  __FILE__ to "eval" (eval code) or "input" (other compiled code) when no
  explicit filename is known; this makes file/line information thrown from
  such code more useful in practice (GH-516, GH-644)

* Add support for non-standard module.filename and module.name used for the
  internal module wrapper function's .fileName and .name properties
  respectively (if unset, defaults are resolved module ID and last component
  of the resolved module ID, respectively); these properties affect e.g.
  stack traces and can now be controlled by modSearch() (GH-639)

* Add a .name property for the require() functions created for included
  modules, so that they have a readable name in stack traces like the top
  level require() function (GH-639)

* Add Windows version of the debugger example TCP transport (GH-579)

* Add support for application specific debugger commands (AppRequest) and
  notifications (AppNotify) (GH-596, GH-563)

* Add duk_debugger_pause() API which allows the target to quickly pause
  ECMAScript execution and break into the debugger (GH-615)

* Add sizeof void pointer to the BasicInfo debugger command (GH-611)

* Extend debugger GetBytecode command to accept an optional callstack level
  or direct heap object argument (GH-610)

* A DukLuv-based JSON debug proxy is now included in the dist package;
  it should allow much easier and more flexible packaging of a JSON debug
  proxy into a debug client (GH-590)

* Use plain integer dvalues when serializing duk_tval numbers in the debugger
  protocol when it's safe to do so, i.e. when the plain integer converts back
  to an identical IEEE double with no loss of precision (GH-604)

* Change the error type for some current internal errors to RangeError when
  the underlying cause is an implementation limit (like compiler temp limit)
  rather than an unexpected internal situation (GH-661)

* Minor changes to error message strings (GH-661)

* Avoid reference loop for eval() code (previously caused by an automatic
  .prototype property added for the internal function the eval source
  compiles to); this allows eval functions to be collected immediately by
  reference counting rather than by mark-and-sweep (GH-717)

* Fix potentially memory unsafe behavior when a refcount-triggered finalizer
  function rescues an object; the memory unsafe behavior doesn't happen
  immediately which makes the cause of the unsafe behavior difficult to
  diagnose (GH-531)

* Fix memory unsafe behavior when an external plain buffer was allocated
  with heap pointer compression enabled (DUK_USE_HEAPPTR16) (GH-618)

* Fix pointer arithmetic portability issues with platforms/compilers with
  exotic pointer models by avoiding arithmetic and binary operations on
  (u)intptr_t values (GH-530, GH-539)

* Fix a genconfig legacy feature option bug in Duktape 1.4.0 which caused
  DUK_USE_PACKED_TVAL to default to false unless forced using
  DUK_OPT_PACKED_TVAL (GH-550)

* Fix debugger Eval handling issue where an uncaught error during Eval
  command (with "pause on uncaught" option enabled) would cause a recursive
  attempt to halt execution (GH-558, GH-562)

* Fix debugger detach handling bug which could cause the debugger to be
  re-entered recursively during detach handling; this could cause various
  difficult to diagnose side effects (GH-599, GH-597, GH-591)

* Fix debugger detach handling bug which could cause detach handling to be
  initiated but not completed if the debug transport write error occurred
  outside of the debugger message loop (for example when writing a Status
  notify in running state) (GH-599, GH-597, GH-591)

* Fix debugger transport write error bug which could cause Duktape to call
  the debug transport write callback after it had already returned an error
  (GH-599)

* Fix debugger PutVar command bug where a failure to read the PutVar variable
  value (e.g. due to a transport detach) could lead to memory unsafe behavior
  (GH-610)

* Fix JSON.stringify() fast path handling of boxed values to actually call
  .toString() and/or .valueOf(); previously the fast path assumed that these
  operations wouldn't be overridden by user code and accessed the internal
  value directly (GH-447)

* Fix conditional compilation for default alloc providers (enabled by
  default using DUK_USE_PROVIDE_DEFAULT_ALLOC_FUNCTIONS) so that if the
  option is disabled there's no reference to malloc(), realloc(), or
  free() during compilation (GH-695)

* Remove branch hint from around setjmp() for better portability (GH-605)

* Portability improvement for Atari Mint: avoid fmin/fmax (GH-556)

* Portability improvement for VS2012 C++ compilation: avoid double definition
  of replacement double constants (GH-595)

* Portability improvement for Windows MSVC: add inline macros (GH-580)

* Portability improvement for FreeBSD: switch to using netinet/in.h header
  instead of inet/arpa.h in debugger socket transport example (GH-676)

* Portability improvement: python tooling (genconfig.py, make_dist.py) etc
  use sys.executable for launching Python scripts so that e.g. "python2
  util/make_dist.py" works on platforms where "python" points to Python 3;
  repo Makefile updated to detect python2 vs. python (GH-646)

* Rework setjmp/longjmp configuration model: (1) removed DUK_OPT_SETJMP,
  DUK_OPT_SIGSETJMP, and DUK_OPT_UNDERSCORE_SETJMP; (2) added DUK_JMPBUF_TYPE
  to duk_config.h to allow the jmp_buf struct to be replaced; (3) Duktape
  internals now rely only on DUK_SETJMP, DUK_LONGJMP, and DUK_JMPBUF_TYPE,
  all configurable via duk_config.h (or config platform definitions) (GH-635)

* Change OS string (visible in Duktape.env) from "ios" to "osx" for non-phone
  targets (GH-570, GH-571)

* Remove readline support from duk_cmdline.c ('duk' command line tool), add
  support for Linenoise instead; -DDUK_CMDLINE_FANCY now assumes linenoise.h
  is in the include path and that linenoise.c is compiled with the command
  line tool (or linked from a library) (GH-678)

* Add minimal tab completion support for duk_cmdline.c ('duk') using Linenoise
  completions (GH-679)

* Internal performance improvement: use raw value stack accessors internally
  when it's safe to do so (GH-582)

* Internal performance improvement: single step encoding for JSON values in
  the JSON slow path (GH-447)

* Internal performance improvement: faster (and smaller) handling of bytecode
  executor 'regconst' fields (GH-670)

* Internal footprint improvement: reduce error call site size (GH-661)

1.5.1 (2016-08-30)
------------------

* Fix a harmless compilation warning related to a shadowed variable (GH-793,
  GH-794)

* Fix incorrect duk_hbufferobject size in Duktape.info() (GH-804)

* Fix compilation error triggered when using pointer compression and the
  default string table implementation (probe-based rather than chained)
  (GH-850)

* Fix potential memory unsafe behavior when duk_push_(l)string() data pointer
  is from a dynamic/external buffer (or any other relocatable data source)
  and a finalizer side effect resizes/reconfigures the buffer, invalidating
  the pointer before string table code has time to copy the data (GH-884)

* Fix lightfunc constructor call handling: lightfuncs were incorrectly
  rejected as constructors, now allowed as both direct constructors and
  via a bound function chain (GH-895)

* Fix direct references to __FILE__ and __LINE__ in the public header to use
  DUK_FILE_MACRO and DUK_LINE_MACRO, which matters if the standard file/line
  macros have been replaced in duk_config.h (GH-897)

* Fix AmigaOS3 portability issue by enabling math function replacements
  automatically for AmigaOS on M68K, regardless of OS version or compiler
  (GH-932)

* Fix clang compile warning for unused duk_err_unsupported_defmsg() (GH-764)

* Reduce harmless "unused function" warnings for GCC and Clang by using
  __attribute__ ((unused)) for internal function declarations (GH-916,
  GH-942)

1.5.2 (2016-12-09)
------------------

* Fix genconfig.py forced option boolean comparison; for forced numeric option
  value 0 genconfig would emit "#undef XXX" (instead of "#define XXX 0") and
  for forced numeric option value 1 it would emit "#define XXX" (instead of
  "#define XXX 1") (GH-954)

* Fix incorrect value stack handling in duk_put_prop_(l)string() and
  duk_put_prop_index() when the target object and the property value
  are in the same value stack slot (which is unusual but conceptually
  clear) (GH-959)

* Fix incorrect buffer zeroing assumption in regexp executor, triggered
  when DUK_USE_ZERO_BUFFER_DATA is not set (default is set) (GH-978)

* Fix incorrect evaluation order of X <op>= Y expressions when the RHS
  (Y) mutates the value of X (GH-992)

* Fix String.fromCharCode() behavior for non-BMP characters when standard
  behavior is enabled (DUK_USE_NONSTD_STRING_FROMCHARCODE_32BIT disabled):
  use ToUint16() + CESU-8 rather than ToUint32() + CESU-8 which produces
  two codepoints for non-BMP characters (GH-1046)

* Fix a few bugs in object property handling (delete property and
  Object.defineProperty()) where an object property table resize triggered
  by a finalizer of a previous value could cause memory unsafe behavior
  (GH-1096)

* Add an extra module (extras/module-duktape) providing a Duktape 1.x
  compatible module loading framework (Duktape.modSearch etc) (GH-821,
  GH-1127)

* Fix duk_hcompfunc 'data' field != NULL assumptions which might lead to
  memory unsafe behavior if Duktape ran out of memory when creating a
  duk_hcompfunc during compilation or function instantiation (GH-1144,
  GH-1132)

* Fix JSON stringify fastpath handling of array gaps in JX and JC; they
  incorrectly stringified as 'null' (like in JSON) instead of 'undefined'
  and '{"_undef":true}' as intended (GH-859, GH-1149)

* Fix memory unsafe handling of Object.isPrototypeOf() when the argument
  given has no prototype (e.g. argument is Object.prototype) (GH-1162,
  GH-1163)

1.6.0 (2016-12-12)
------------------

* Add duk_suspend() and duk_resume() which allow a native thread running a
  Duktape/C function to be suspended temporarily (e.g. when a native system
  call blocks) so that other native threads may execute while the thread is
  blocked (GH-893, GH-909)

1.6.1 (2017-01-15)
------------------

* Fix compile error when using 16-bit fields and disabling refcounting at
  the same time (GH-1207)

* Fix an incorrect assert in RegExp code for character class dashes (GH-1250)

* Fix duk_hstring array index check integer overflow, which caused certain
  integer strings (such as '7394299990') to be incorrectly treated as array
  indices (GH-1273, GH-1276)

1.7.0 (2017-03-20)
------------------

* Fix duk_push_buffer_object() ArrayBuffer .byteLength to use 0 and .byteOffset
  to use view's (byteOffset + byteLength), so that accesses to the ArrayBuffer
  at the view's .byteOffset match the view at index 0 as normally expected;
  previously .byteOffset and .byteLength were copied from the view as is which
  makes the ArrayBuffer indices behave inconsistently with respect to the
  view's .byteOffset (GH-1229)

* Add duk_is_buffer_data() API call to reliably test whether a value stack
  entry is a plain buffer or any buffer object (GH-1221)

* Improve duk_push_heapptr() assert validation to include checks that the
  pointer is only allowed in finalize_list or refzero_list if currently being
  finalized, and must otherwise be in either the string table (for strings)
  or heap_allocated (non-strings) (GH-1317)

* Fix an incorrect assert in RegExp code for character class dashes (GH-1250)

* Fix duk_hstring array index check integer overflow, which caused certain
  integer strings (such as '7394299990') to be incorrectly treated as array
  indices (GH-1273, GH-1276)

* Fix a few incorrect asserts related to reference count triggered finalizer
  execution; the functionality itself was correct in these cases but a few
  asserts were too strict (GH-1318)

* Fix a duk_push_heapptr() finalize_list assertion issue caused by the
  internal heap->finalize_list being (intentionally) out-of-sync during
  mark-and-sweep finalizer execution; this has no functional impact but
  breaks duk_push_heapptr() asserts in certain conditions (GH-1321)

* Fix ROM pointer duk_heaphdr_incref() handling when slow refcount default
  was enabled (GH-1320)

* Fix -Wshift-sign-overflow warnings on some Clang versions for signed left
  shifts whose result was used as unsigned (GH-812, GH-813)

* Fix bug in global object environment "provideThis" attribute when using ROM
  objects and DUK_USE_ROM_GLOBAL_INHERIT (GH-1340, GH-1310)

* Fix a garbage collection bug where a finalizer triggered by mark-and-sweep
  could cause a recursive entry into mark-and-sweep (leading to memory unsafe
  behavior) if the voluntary GC trigger counter dropped to zero during
  mark-and-sweep finalizer execution (GH-1347, GH-1355)

* Fix bug in global/eval code variable redeclaration handling where a
  plain 'var X;' redeclaration for an existing binding caused 'undefined' to
  overwrite the existing binding rather than being treated as a no-op
  (GH-1351, GH-1354)

* Fix some stale activation ('act') pointer handling which could lead to
  memory unsafe behavior in some cases (GH-1370, GH-1371, GH-1373)

* Fix duk_is_constructor_call() for an empty callstack (GH-1376)

* Fix debugger Throw notify handling for an empty callstack (e.g. error
  thrown by duk_throw() with nothing on the callstack) (GH-1377)

* Fix module-duktape and module-node handling of a module source which has
  a // comment on the last line without a trailing newline (GH-1394, GH-1395)

1.8.0 (2017-08-02)
------------------

* Mix in current time to PRNG init in Duktape 1.x too; prior to this change
  only the allocated duk_heap pointer was used for PRNG init, leading to the
  same sequence being used on some platforms (GH-1446)

* Fix out-of-memory handling for object property table resize, previously
  an out-of-memory during property table resize could leave internal state
  in a state which prevented mark-and-sweep from fully working afterwards
  (GH-1426, GH-1427)

* Fix RegExp group parsing to reject invalid groups like /(?Xabc)/, previously
  they were accepted silently (GH-1463)

* Fix potentially stale duk_tval pointer in Proxy deleteProperty handling
  (GH-1482)

* Fix missing duk_require_stack() in bound function call handling which caused
  calls to bound functions with a lot of bound arguments to fail with a value
  stack limit error (GH-1504)

* Fix duk_hbufobj assert in shared slice() handling (GH-1506)

* Fix duk_check_stack_top() and duk_require_stack_top() internal value stack
  reserve calculation which failed to take into account call stack entries
  below the current call, leading potentially to a smaller reserve than
  requested (GH-1536)

* Fix duk_pcall_prop(), duk_safe_call(), and duk_pnew() argument validation,
  in some cases a negative nargs/nrets argument (which is always invalid)
  could be accepted (GH-1553)

2.0.0 (2017-01-02)
------------------

Tooling:

* Incompatible change: remove feature option (DUK_OPT_xxx) support, use
  tools/configure.py (or tools/genconfig.py) or edit duk_config.h manually
  to use custom config options (GH-949)

* Incompatible change: tools/configure.py is the new frontend tool for
  configuring Duktape: it generates both a duk_config.h config header,
  prepares amalgamated source files for build, and supports ROM built-ins;
  raw input source files are included in the end user distributable to
  allow tools/configure.py to be used without a repo checkout (GH-949, GH-927,
  GH-928, GH-929)

* Genconfig.py is still available (moved to tools/genconfig.py) but is no
  longer recommended for configuring Duktape, use tools/configure.py instead
  (GH-949, GH-927, GH-928, GH-929)

* util/dist.py no longer supports ROM built-ins, use tools/configure.py
  instead (GH-949, GH-929)

* Add support for converting ROM function property values into lightfuncs in
  genbuiltins.py to reduce code footprint for ROM-based built-ins and custom
  bindings; footprint reduction is around 14-15kB on 32-bit targets (GH-872)

* Fix genconfig.py forced option boolean comparison; for forced numeric option
  value 0 genconfig would emit "#undef XXX" (instead of "#define XXX 0") and
  for forced numeric option value 1 it would emit "#define XXX" (instead of
  "#define XXX 1") (GH-954)

Configuration:

* Incompatible change: remove Duktape internal and user "InitJS" support
  (DUK_USE_BUILTIN_INITJS and DUK_USE_USER_INITJS) which were very rarely
  used and required minify tools to make a dist package (GH-899)

* Require a DUK_USE_DEBUG_WRITE() macro for handling debug writes when
  DUK_USE_DEBUG is enabled; this avoids a platform I/O dependency and allows
  debug log filtering and retargeting (GH-782)

* Use DUK_USE_DEBUG_LEVEL for debug print level control rather than the
  previous DUK_USE_DPRINT, DUK_USE_DDPRINT, and DUK_USE_DDDPRINT defines
  (GH-783)

* Add support for dropping built-in bindings entirely when they are disabled
  in configuration, e.g. the Proxy and buffer object bindings will be absent
  instead of being replaced by functions throwing an error; this is more
  in line with how applications detect supported features and also reduces
  footprint (GH-988)

* Remove no longer needed platform wrappers in duk_config.h: DUK_ABORT(),
  DUK_EXIT(), DUK_PRINTF(), DUK_FPRINTF(), DUK_FOPEN(), DUK_FCLOSE(),
  DUK_FREAD(), DUK_FWRITE(), DUK_FSEEK(), DUK_FTELL(), DUK_FFLUSH(),
  DUK_FPUTC(), DUK_STDOUT, DUK_STDERR, DUK_STDIN, duk_file (GH-787, GH-761)

* Make coroutine support optional (DUK_USE_COROUTINE_SUPPORT); disabling
  coroutines reduces code footprint by about 2kB (GH-829)

* Make finalizer support optional (DUK_USE_FINALIZER_SUPPORT); disabling
  coroutines reduces code footprint by about 0.8kB (GH-936)

* Reduce RAM built-ins initdata limitations for custom bindings by using a
  shared varuint encoding in the bit-packed initdata stream (GH-1151, GH-1152)

* Remove support for refcounting-only (= no mark-and-sweep) memory management
  option as too error prone: without mark-and-sweep garbage containing
  reference loops or created during debugger paused state (with or without
  reference loops) would seemingly leak until heap destruction (GH-1168)

* Add DUK_USE_GET_RANDOM_DOUBLE() config option to allow an application
  to override the built-in random number generator (which is very simple
  and low footprint optimized) with something faster or better (GH-824)

* Make Array property read/write fast path optional to reduce footprint
  for footprint optimized builds (ensure DUK_USE_ARRAY_PROP_FASTPATH is
  disabled for low memory builds) (GH-934)

Buffers:

* Incompatible change: rework buffer types and their ECMAScript and C API
  behavior: remove Duktape.Buffer; provide Uint8Array.allocPlain() and
  Uint8Array.plainOf() to replace Duktape.Buffer; plain buffers now behave
  like Uint8Arrays and inherit from Uint8Array.prototype; plain buffers now
  test false in duk_is_primitive() which is more consistent with their
  ECMAScript coercion behavior; many small changes in how built-in functions
  behave for plain buffer arguments e.g. in enumeration, JSON serialization,
  and Object.prototype.toString() output (GH-875, GH-1005, GH-864, GH-1197)

* Incompatible change: remove the ability to do a 1:1 buffer-to-string
  coercion (using buffer data directly as the internal string representation)
  from the default ECMAScript bindings, an encoding (usually UTF-8) is now
  always applied (GH-875, GH-1005)

* Incompatible change: remove non-standard properties from ArrayBuffer
  instances (.length, .byteOffset, virtual index properties) and DataView
  instances (.length, virtual index properties) (GH-867, GH-1197)

* Incompatible change: when DUK_USE_BUFFEROBJECT_SUPPORT is disabled, don't
  support coercing plain buffers to Uint8Arrays, or any other buffer object
  operations (including all ArrayBuffer, typed array, and Node.js Buffer
  methods); this reduces code footprint by around 1.2 kB (GH-889)

* Incompatible change: Node.js Buffer binding aligned with Node.js v6.7.0
  (from v0.12.1): Buffer.concat() special case for 1-element array removed
  (GH-1004); Buffer now inherits from Uint8Array (GH-1008);
  Buffer.prototype.toString() does UTF-8 decoding (previously buffer data
  was copied into internal string representation as is) (GH-1020)

* Incompatible change: typed array .subarray() and Node.js buffer .slice()
  result internal prototype is now the default prototype of the result
  type (e.g. initial value of Uint8Array.prototype) rather than being
  copied from the argument (GH-864)

* Incompatible change: minor changes to buffer object behavior when buffer
  types are mixed (e.g. Node.js Buffer as an argument to typed array calls)
  (GH-864)

* Incompatible change: allow a plain buffer as a constructor "replacement
  object" return value (GH-1197)

* Reject ArrayBuffers with a view offset/length in Node.js Buffer .slice()
  rather than accept such ArrayBuffers without actually respecting the
  view offset/length (GH-1197)

* Disable JSON stringify fastpath for plain buffers for now so that the
  virtual index properties get serialized correctly; fastpath to be added
  back separately (GH-1197)

* As a side effect of fixing JSON serialization of buffer objects, JSON
  fast path is aborted when encountering buffer objects; the fast path
  doesn't currently handle buffer object virtual properties correctly
  so to remain compliant fall back to slow path for now (GH-867)

* Fix duk_push_buffer_object() ArrayBuffer .byteLength to use 0 and .byteOffset
  to use view's (byteOffset + byteLength), so that accesses to the ArrayBuffer
  at the view's .byteOffset match the view at index 0 as normally expected;
  previously .byteOffset and .byteLength were copied from the view as is which
  makes the ArrayBuffer indices behave inconsistently with respect to the
  view's .byteOffset (GH-1229)

* Fix buffer object (duk_hbufobj) JSON serialization (bug present in 1.5.0):
  buffer objects were omitted from serialization when they should be
  serialized as normal objects instead (GH-867)

Other type changes:

* Incompatible change: allow a lightfunc as a constructor "replacement
  object" return value (GH-1197)

* Incompatible change: plain pointer values now test true in instanceof
  (plainPointer instanceof Duktape.Pointer === true) (GH-864)

* Incompatible change: lightfunc values now test false in duk_is_primitive()
  which is more consistent with how they behave in ECMAScript coercions
  (GH-864)

* Incompatible change: lightfunc value as a "this" binding is ToObject()
  coerced to a full Function object if the call target is non-strict (this
  matches e.g. string and plain buffer behavior) (GH-864)

Debugger:

* Incompatible change: rename duk_debugger_attach_custom() API call to
  duk_debugger_attach() to eliminate an unnecessary API call variant
  (GH-735, GH-742)

* Incompatible change: debug protocol version bumped from 1 to 2 to indicate
  version incompatible protocol changes in the 2.0.0 release (GH-756)

* Incompatible change: make callstack level mandatory for most debugger
  commands which accept one (GH-747, GH-1109)

* Incompatible change: change some debugger artificial property names to match
  internal renames: compiledfunction -> compfunc, nativefunction -> natfunc,
  bufferobject -> bufobj (GH-798)

* Incompatible change: add a "ctx" argument to the debugger detached_cb to
  allow easier reattachment in detached callback (GH-758, GH-853)

* Incompatible change: debugger inspection of array objects no longer sees a
  concrete .length property for arrays because of internal duk_harray type
  related changes; instead, an artificial property "length" is available via
  GetHeapObjInfo (GH-703, GH-856)

* Add ability to perform an indirect debugger Eval with non-empty callstack by
  sending null for the callstack level (GH-747)

* Rename debugger protocol artificial property "bound" to "boundfunc" for
  consistency with an internal flag rename (GH-703)

ECMAScript 2015+ and real world compatibility:

* Change Object constructor argument coercion policy to match ES2015
  requirements for .keys(), .getOwnPropertyNames(),
  .getOwnPropertyDescriptor(), .getPrototypeOf(), .freeze(), .isFrozen(),
  .seal(), .isSealed(), .preventExtensions(), and .isExtensible();
  instead of rejecting non-objects with a TypeError, they are now coerced
  to objects or treated as non-extensible objects with no own properties
  (GH-1028, GH-1164)

* Add experimental support for ES2015 Symbol built-in (disabled by default,
  enable using DUK_USE_SYMBOL_BUILTIN), duk_is_symbol() API call (GH-982,
  GH-1227, GH-1237)

* Allow ES2015 Annex B unescaped right bracket (']') in regular expressions
  (non-standard before ES2015 Annex B), left bracket ('[') not yet supported
  because it needs backtracking (GH-871)

* Allow ES2015 Annex B identity escapes, i.e. allow identity escapes also for
  identifier part characters; the support is not yet complete as Duktape
  won't backtrack on e.g. an invalid hex escape and treat it literally
  (GH-926)

* Add support for ES2015 computed property names in object literals
  ({ [1+2]: 'three' }), identifier shorthand ({ foo, bar }), and method
  definition shorthand ({ func(a,b) { return a+b; } }); however, computed
  name for method definition ({ ['foo' + 'bar'](a,b) { ... } }) is not
  yet supported (GH-985, GH-1190, GH-1193, GH-1246)

* Add support for ES2016 exponentiation and exponentiation assignment
  operators, e.g. "2 \*\* 10" evaluates to 1024, avoiding the cost of an
  ECMAScript call to Math.pow() while also being more readable (GH-987,
  GH-997)

* Add a Reflect built-in, provides Reflect.construct() etc. from ES2015; some
  features like constructor retargeting require ES2015+ semantics and are thus
  not yet supported (GH-1025)

* Add support for ES2015 \\u{H+} escape syntax for source code string literals
  and identifiers, no RegExp support yet (requires RegExp /u Unicode mode)
  (GH-1001)

* Add support for ES2015 octal (0o123) and binary (0b100001) in source code
  literals and ToNumber() coercion (e.g. "+'0o123'") (GH-1057, GH-1084)

* Add support for ES2015 String.prototype.codePointAt(), String.fromCodePoint(),
  and String.prototype.repeat() (GH-1043, GH-1049, GH-1050)

* Add support for ES2015 Math.hypot(), Math.cbrt(), Math.log2(), Math.log10(),
  Math.trunc() (GH-1069, GH-1093, GH-1095)

* Add support for ES2015 Object.assign() (GH-1064)

* Add support for ES2015 Object.is() and duk_samevalue() API call (GH-1068)

* Respect ES2015 enumeration order (array index keys, other keys in insertion
  order) for Object.getOwnPropertyNames(), also use the same order in
  for-in, Object.keys(), and duk_enum() even though that's not strictly
  required by ES2015 or ES2016 (GH-1054)

* Follow ES2016 behavior when a Proxy instance is used as a for-in target:
  the "ownKeys" trap is invoked instead of the "enumerate" trap, and the
  "enumerate" trap is thus obsoleted entirely (GH-1115)

* Add enumerability check for properties enumerated using Proxy "ownKeys"
  trap; because "getOwnPropertyDescriptor" trap is not yet supported, the
  check is always made against the target object (GH-1115)

* Align RegExp.prototype behavior more closely with ES2015: .source, .global,
  .ignoreCase, .multiline are now inherited getters; .flags, .sticky, and
  .unicode have been added (they are inherited getters too); constructor
  behavior has been revised for ES2015 behavior; however, leniency to allow
  e.g. RegExp.prototype.source (from ES2017 draft) is supported for real
  world code compatibility (GH-1178)

* Update UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt used for building internal
  Unicode control data to Unicode version 9.0.0 (GH-931)

* Change parsing of legacy octal literals so that 077 is parsed as octal
  (= 63) but 078 is parsed as decimal (78) rather than causing a SyntaxError;
  this aligns better with behavior of other engines (GH-1057)

* Change parsing of octal escapes in string literals to better align with
  ES2015 and other engines; "\\078" is now accepted and is the same as
  "\\u00078", "\\8" and "\\9" are accepted as literal "8" and "9"  (GH-1057)

* Change bound function .name property handling to match ES2015 requirements;
  for a target function with name "foo", bound function name is "bound foo"
  (GH-1113)

* Change bound function internal prototype handling to match ES2015 requirements;
  bound function internal prototype is copied from the target function
  instead of always being Function.prototype (GH-1135)

* Change Function.prototype.toString() output to match ES2015 requirements;
  the output no longer parses with eval() but causes a SyntaxError instead
  (GH-1141)

* Make function instance .name and .length properties configurable (but
  non-writable and non-enumerable) to match ES2015 requirements; also change
  .fileName to follow the same attribute convention (GH-1153, GH-1177)

* Remove anonymous function own .name property to match ES2015 requirements;
  anonymous functions inherit an empty string as their name from
  Function.prototype.name (GH-1183)

* Change functions created using new Function() to have the .name
  "anonymous" to match ES2015 requirements (GH-1183)

* Make Error instance .fileName and .lineNumber properties configurable
  but non-writable and non-enumerable to match function instance property
  behavior; this only matters when tracebacks are disabled and concrete
  error instance properties are in use (GH-1153)

* Change NativeError (TypeError, RangeError, etc) constructor to inherit
  from the Error constructor rather than Function.prototype directly as
  required by ES2015 (GH-1182)

* Change object literal getter/setter to match ES2015 requirements: no automatic
  .prototype property, and the functions are non-constructable (GH-1188)

* Allow duplicate property names in object literals as required by ES2015
  (GH-1190)

* Change typed array constructor chain to match ES2015, e.g. Uint8Array
  constructor inherits from intrinsic %TypedArray% constructor (GH-1191)

* Move typed array properties .byteLength, .byteOffset, and .buffer to
  prototype objects and make them (inherited) accessors to better match
  ES2015 requirements; .length remains a virtual own property (GH-1197)

WHATWG Encoding API:

* Add TextEncoder and TextDecoder built-ins (the Encoding API) which allow
  ECMAScript code to convert between buffers and strings using the UTF-8
  encoding (GH-975)

Other C API changes:

* Incompatible change: add a userdata argument to duk_safe_call() to make it
  easier to pass C pointers to safe functions (GH-277, GH-727)

* Incompatible change: remove duk_dump_context_{stdout,stderr}() to avoid a
  dependency on stdout/stderr which is a porting issue (GH-736, GH-743)

* Incompatible change: remove file related Duktape C API calls to avoid a
  dependency on platform file I/O which is a porting issue; removed calls
  (which were moved into extras): duk_push_string_file(), duk_compile_file(),
  duk_pcompile_file(), duk_eval_file(), duk_eval_file_noresult(),
  duk_peval_file(), duk_peval_file_noresult() (GH-788)

* Incompatible change: remove the distinction between panic and fatal errors,
  and simplify the fatal error handler function signature to
  "void my_fatal(void \*udata, const char \*msg);" (GH-781)

* Incompatible change: remove error code argument from duk_fatal() API
  call to match revised fatal error handler function signature (GH-781)

* Incompatible change: default fatal error handler (similar to panic handler
  in Duktape 1.x) calls abort() without printing anything to stdout or stderr
  (which avoids unnecessary platform dependencies); this behavior can be
  overridden by defining DUK_USE_FATAL_HANDLER() in duk_config.h (GH-781,
  GH-1218)

* Incompatible change: remove Duktape specific error codes DUK_ERR_ALLOC_ERROR,
  DUK_ERR_API_ERROR, DUK_ERR_ASSERTION_ERROR, DUK_ERR_INTERNAL_ERROR,
  DUK_ERR_UNCAUGHT_ERROR, DUK_ERR_UNIMPLEMENTED_ERROR,
  DUK_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ERROR; use standard error types instead (GH-827)

* Incompatible change: map API related errors (which previously used
  DUK_ERR_API_ERROR and a plain Error for ECMAScript representation) into
  TypeErrors and RangeErrors to match common ECMAScript conventions (GH-827)

* Incompatible change: remove duk_to_defaultvalue() which invoked the
  [[DefaultValue]] specification algorithm removed in ES2015 (it was folded
  to ToPrimitive()), use duk_to_primitive() instead (GH-984)

* Incompatible change: duk_gc() no longer allows a NULL context pointer
  for consistency with other API calls (GH-1129)

* Change return from of duk_throw(), duk_error(), and duk_fatal() from void
  to duk_ret_t which allows them to be called using the idiom
  "return duk_error(ctx, DUK_ERR_TYPE_ERROR, "invalid argument");"
  (GH-1038, GH-1041)

* Add convenience API calls to throw specific error types; for example,
  duk_type_error(), duk_type_error_va(), duk_range_error(), etc (GH-1040)

* Add convenience API calls duk_get_prop_lstring(), duk_put_prop_lstring(),
  duk_del_prop_lstring(), duk_has_prop_lstring(), duk_get_global_lstring(),
  duk_put_global_lstring() (GH-946, GH-953)

* Add a ToPropertyKey() coercion to duk_def_prop() key argument to allow
  e.g. numbers to be used in the key slot (GH-836, GH-1130)

* Add duk_get_prop_desc() API call which pushes a property descriptor object
  for a target object and key, similar to Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
  (GH-1087)

* Add duk_suspend() and duk_resume() which allow a native thread running a
  Duktape/C function to be suspended temporarily (e.g. when a native system
  call blocks) so that other native threads may execute while the thread is
  blocked (GH-893, GH-909)

* Add duk_is_buffer_data() API call to reliably test whether a value stack
  entry is a plain buffer or any buffer object (GH-1221)

* Add time functions to the C API (duk_get_now(), duk_time_to_components(),
  duk_components_to_time()) to allow C code to conveniently work with the
  same time provider as seen by ECMAScript code (GH-771, GH-1209, GH-1211,
  GH-1226)

* Add duk_push_bare_object() API call which pushes an object without an
  internal prototype, equivalent to Object.create(null) (GH-1126)

* Add DUK_GC_COMPACT flag to duk_gc() to force object property table
  compaction (GH-778, GH-1129)

* Add duk_inspect_value() to provide internal information about an argument
  value; the output matches Duktape.info() (GH-1125)

* Add duk_inspect_callstack_entry() to provide internal information about a
  callstack entry; the output matches Duktape.act() (GH-1128)

* Add duk_set_length() API call and change duk_get_length() limits from
  uint32 to size_t supported range (GH-1123)

* Remove duk_{get,put,has,del}_var() calls from API header; they were not
  fully implemented and not part of the documented public API (GH-762)

Other ECMAScript binding changes:

* Incompatible change: remove built-in print() and alert() bindings which,
  being dependent on stdout/stderr, are often a portability issue (GH-745)

* Incompatible change: remove the built-in logging framework (Duktape.Logger,
  duk_log(), duk_log_va()); now provided as an extra (GH-746, GH-790)

* Incompatible change: remove the built-in module loading framework (global
  require() call, Duktape.modSearch() etc); now provided as an extra (GH-821)

* Incompatible change: Duktape.info() output has been changed from an array
  (which is difficult to version and work with) to an object with named
  properties; the properties are not under versioning guarantees (GH-1125)

* Allow a bound ECMAScript function as an argument to new Duktape.Thread()
  (GH-1134, GH-1157)

Extras:

* Add an extra module (extras/duk-v1-compat) providing many Duktape 1.x API
  calls removed in Duktape 2.x (multiple Github issues)

* Add an extra module (extras/print-alert) providing Duktape 1.x compatible
  print() and alert() bindings (GH-745)

* Add an extra module (extras/logging) providing Duktape 1.x compatible
  logging framework (Duktape.Logger, duk_log(), duk_log_va()) (GH-746)

* Add an extra module (extras/console) providing a minimal 'console' binding
  (GH-767)

* Add an extra module (extras/module-duktape) providing a Duktape 1.x
  compatible module loading framework (Duktape.modSearch etc) (GH-821,
  GH-1127)

* Add an extra module (extras/module-node) providing a Node.js-like module
  loading framework supporting require.cache, module.loaded, etc. (GH-796,
  GH-1127)

* Add an extra module (extras/minimal-printf) providing minimal,
  Duktape-optimized sprintf(), snprintf(), vsnprintf(), and sscanf()
  implementations; the extra compiles to less than 1kB of code which is
  useful on bare metal platforms where an external printf() or scanf()
  dependency may have a large footprint impact (often 10-30 kB) (GH-801)

* Add an extra module (extras/alloc-pool) providing an improved pool
  allocator which supports runtime resizing of pool counts to specified
  memory target and realloc shrinking (GH-847)

Portability:

* Miscellaneous portability improvements: remove dependency on fmin() and
  fmax() (GH-1072); remove signed shifts in lightfunc handling (GH-1172)

* Fix ARM64 platform detection for some Android targets (GH-1062)

* Fix AmigaOS3 portability issue by enabling math function replacements
  automatically for AmigaOS on M68K, regardless of OS version or compiler
  (GH-932)

* Fix Cygwin warning about shadowed 'accept' variable (GH-1098)

* Fix Cygwin/MinGW math issues related to pow2() and atan2() semantics
  (GH-1099)

* Add an fmod() self test (GH-1108)

* Add an FP rounding mode self test (Duktape assumes rounding mode is
  IEEE 754 round-to-nearest, C99 FE_TONEAREST) (GH-606)

* Add a minimal alloc/realloc/free self test to the (optional) internal
  self test (GH-877)

Performance:

* Simplify call related bytecode opcodes for better performance; as a
  result maximum argument count to normal and constructor calls dropped
  from 511 to 255, and calling a user function (i.e. not the built-in
  native eval()) via the identifier 'eval' doesn't get tailcall
  optimization (GH-896)

* Internal performance improvement: rework bytecode format to use an 8-bit
  opcode field (and 8-bit A, B, and C fields) to speed up opcode dispatch
  by around 20-25% and avoid a two-level dispatch for EXTRA opcodes; the
  performance optimized build is ~10kB larger while footprint optimized
  build is slightly smaller (GH-903)

* Internal performance improvement: add optional fast path for dense arrays in
  Array.prototype operations like push() and pop() (GH-584, GH-1154)

* Add an internal type for representing Array instances (duk_harray) to
  simplify array operations and improve performance; this also changes the
  key order of Object.getOwnPropertyNames() for sparse arrays (arrays whose
  internal "array part" has been abandoned) (GH-703)

* Add a fastint check for duk_put_number_list() values (GH-1086)

* Remove an unintended fastint downgrade check for unary minus executor
  opcode (fastint downgrade check is intended to be applied to unary plus
  only) (GH-903)

* Miscellaneous performance improvements: avoid one extra shift when computing
  reg/const pointers in the bytecode executor (GH-674); avoid value stack for
  Array .length coercion (GH-862); value stack operation optimization
  (GH-891); call related bytecode simplification (GH-896); minor bytecode
  opcode handler optimizations (GH-903); refcount optimizations (GH-443,
  GH-973, GH-1042); minor RegExp compile/execute optimizations (GH-974,
  GH-1033); minor IEEE double handling optimizations (GH-1051); precomputed
  duk_hstring array index (GH-1056); duk_get_{type,type_mask}() optimization
  (GH-1077); explicit lexenv/varenv fields in duk_hcompfunc struct (GH-1132)

Footprint:

* Miscellaneous footprint improvements: RegExp compiler/executor (GH-977);
  internal duk_dup() variants (GH-990); allow stripping of (almost) all
  built-ins for low memory builds (GH-989); remove internal accessor setup
  helper and use duk_def_prop() instead (GH-1010); minor IEEE double handling
  optimizations (GH-1051); precomputed duk_hstring array index (GH-1056);
  internal value stack access improvements (GH-1058); shared bitpacked string
  format for heap and thread initialization data (GH-1119); explicit
  lexenv/varenv fields in duk_hcompfunc struct (GH-1132); omit duk_hcompfunc
  _Formals array when it is safe to do so (GH-1141); omit duk_hcompfunc
  _Varmap in more cases when it is safe to do so (GH-1146); reduce initial
  bytecode allocation in ECMAScript compiler for low memory targets (GH-1146);
  packed arguments for some internal helper calls (GH-1158, GH-1172); misc
  internal helpers to reduce call site size (GH-1166, GH-1173); config options
  for function .name and .fileName control (GH-1153); internal helper
  duk_push_hstring_empty() (GH-1186, GH-1220)

Other bug fixes:

* Fix JSON stringify fastpath handling of array gaps in JX and JC; they
  incorrectly stringified as 'null' (like in JSON) instead of 'undefined'
  and '{"_undef":true}' as intended (GH-859, GH-1149)

* Fix duk_hcompfunc 'data' field != NULL assumptions which might lead to
  memory unsafe behavior if Duktape ran out of memory when creating a
  duk_hcompfunc during compilation or function instantiation (GH-1144,
  GH-1132)

* Fix a few bugs in object property handling (delete property and
  Object.defineProperty()) where an object property table resize triggered
  by a finalizer of a previous value could cause memory unsafe behavior
  (GH-1096)

* Fix Object.prototype.__proto__ handling to use ToObject() coercion rather
  than requiring an object; this matches ES2015 requirements and allows e.g.
  the expression (123).__proto__ to work (GH-1080)

* Fix String.fromCharCode() behavior for non-BMP characters when standard
  behavior is enabled (DUK_USE_NONSTD_STRING_FROMCHARCODE_32BIT disabled):
  use ToUint16() + CESU-8 rather than ToUint32() + CESU-8 which produces
  two codepoints for non-BMP characters (GH-1046)

* Fix incorrect evaluation order of X <op>= Y expressions when the RHS
  (Y) mutates the value of X (GH-992)

* Fix incorrect buffer zeroing assumption in regexp executor, triggered
  when DUK_USE_ZERO_BUFFER_DATA is not set (default is set) (GH-978)

* Fix incorrect value stack handling in duk_put_prop_(l)string() and
  duk_put_prop_index() when the target object and the property value
  are in the same value stack slot (which is unusual but conceptually
  clear) (GH-959)

* Fix compilation error triggered when using pointer compression and the
  default string table implementation (probe-based rather than chained)
  (GH-850)

* Fix a harmless compilation warning related to a shadowed variable (GH-793,
  GH-794)

* Fix -Wshadow warnings on some GCC versions for variable/argument name
  'index' by avoiding such identifiers in API and internals (GH-810)

* Fix -Wshift-sign-overflow warnings on some Clang versions for signed left
  shifts whose result was used as unsigned (GH-812, GH-813)

* Fix JSON.stringify (and JX/JC encode) fast path to allow arrays whose
  .length is larger than the internal array part size (created e.g. when
  calling new Array(10)) without falling back to the slow path (GH-703)

* Fix potential memory unsafe behavior when duk_push_(l)string() data pointer
  is from a dynamic/external buffer (or any other relocatable data source)
  and a finalizer side effect resizes/reconfigures the buffer, invalidating
  the pointer before string table code has time to copy the data (GH-884)

* Fix lightfunc constructor call handling: lightfuncs were incorrectly
  rejected as constructors, now allowed as both direct constructors and
  via a bound function chain (GH-895)

* Fix direct references to __FILE__ and __LINE__ in the public header to use
  DUK_FILE_MACRO and DUK_LINE_MACRO, which matters if the standard file/line
  macros have been replaced in duk_config.h (GH-897)

* Fix two-argument Math function (like Math.atan2()) argument coercion
  order; the order was not guaranteed but specification requires left-to-right
  ordering (GH-943)

* Reduce harmless "unused function" warnings for GCC and Clang by using
  __attribute__ ((unused)) for internal function declarations (GH-916,
  GH-942)

* Fix incorrect duk_hbufferobject size in Duktape.info() (GH-804)

* Fix a few incorrect asserts in refcount code; the asserts didn't check for
  NULL and cause memory unsafe behavior, but the code itself is correct
  (GH-1090)

* Fix memory unsafe handling of Object.isPrototypeOf() when the argument
  given has no prototype (e.g. argument is Object.prototype) (GH-1162,
  GH-1163)

* Fix compile error when using 16-bit fields and disabling refcounting at
  the same time (GH-1207)

* Fix an incorrect assert in RegExp code for character class dashes (GH-1250)

Miscellaneous:

* Incompatible change: bytecode opcode format reworks drop maximum function
  and constructor call argument count from 511 to 255, and maximum ECMAScript
  function constant count from 262144 to 65536 (GH-903)

* Add a human readable summary of 'new MyConstructor()' constructor call
  target when the target is non-constructable (GH-757)

* Add a safe summary for "uncaught error" fatal error (GH-832)

* Minor changes to error messages for errors thrown by Duktape internals
  (GH-827, GH-839, GH-840, GH-1016)

* Change default built-in PRNG algorithm to xoroshiro128+ with SplitMix64
  seed mixing; previous algorithm (Shamir's three-op algorithm) is still
  used for low memory targets and targets without 64-bit types (GH-970)

* Internal change: rework shared internal string handling so that shared
  strings are plain string constants used in macro values, rather than
  being declared as actual symbols; this reduces compilation warnings with
  non-default config options (GH-760)

* Internal change: shorten internal struct names to improve source code
  readability: duk_hcompiledfunction -> duk_hcompfunc,
  duk_hnativefunction -> duk_hnatfunc, duk_hbufferobject -> duk_hbufobj
  (GH-798)

* Internal change: avoid explicit casts for 'switch' statement arguments,
  other internal cast fixes (GH-825)

* Internal change: rework tagged value (duk_tval) fastint/integer handling
  macros to avoid multiple evaluation of argument(s) and for easier mixing
  of fastint and non-fastint aware code (GH-702)

* Internal change: source code policy changes (GH-1169)

2.0.1 (2017-01-27)
------------------

* Fix memory unsafe behavior in Duktape 2.0.0 String.prototype.repeat()
  (GH-1270)

* Fix incorrect exponentiation operator behavior which happened at least on
  Linux gcc 4.8.4 with -O2 (not -Os) (GH-1272)

* Fix duk_hstring array index check integer overflow, which caused certain
  integer strings (such as '7394299990') to be incorrectly treated as array
  indices (GH-1273, GH-1276)

* Fix argument validation bug in typedarray .set() which would cause a segfault
  for e.g. new Float64Array(2).set(undefined) (GH-1285, GH-1286)

* Fix incorrect behavior for new TextEncoder().encode('') (applied to an
  empty string) which manifested at least on MSVC (GH-1293, GH-1294)

* Fix a few incorrect asserts related to reference count triggered finalizer
  execution; the functionality itself was correct in these cases but a few
  asserts were too strict (GH-1318)

* Improve duk_push_heapptr() assert validation to include checks that the
  pointer is only allowed in finalize_list or refzero_list if currently being
  finalized, and must otherwise be in either the string table (for strings)
  or heap_allocated (non-strings) (GH-1317)

* Fix a duk_push_heapptr() finalize_list assertion issue caused by the
  internal heap->finalize_list being (intentionally) out-of-sync during
  mark-and-sweep finalizer execution; this has no functional impact but
  breaks duk_push_heapptr() asserts in certain conditions (GH-1321)

* Fix ROM pointer duk_heaphdr_incref() handling when slow refcount default
  was enabled (GH-1320)

2.0.2 (2017-03-20)
------------------

* Avoid log2(), log10(), cbrt(), and trunc() on Android (GH-1325, GH-1341)

* Portability improvements for Solaris, HPUX, and AIX (GH-1356)

* Fix 'duk' command line bytecode load error (GH-1333, GH-1334)

* Fix bug in global object environment "provideThis" attribute when using ROM
  objects and DUK_USE_ROM_GLOBAL_INHERIT (GH-1340, GH-1310)

* Fix a garbage collection bug where a finalizer triggered by mark-and-sweep
  could cause a recursive entry into mark-and-sweep (leading to memory unsafe
  behavior) if the voluntary GC trigger counter dropped to zero during
  mark-and-sweep finalizer execution (GH-1347, GH-1355)

* Fix bug in global/eval code variable redeclaration handling where a
  plain 'var X;' redeclaration for an existing binding caused 'undefined' to
  overwrite the existing binding rather than being treated as a no-op
  (GH-1351, GH-1354)

* Fix some stale activation ('act') pointer handling which could lead to
  memory unsafe behavior in some cases (GH-1370, GH-1371, GH-1373)

* Fix duk_is_constructor_call() for an empty callstack (GH-1376)

* Fix debugger Throw notify handling for an empty callstack (e.g. error
  thrown by duk_throw() with nothing on the callstack) (GH-1377)

* Fix module-duktape and module-node handling of a module source which has
  a // comment on the last line without a trailing newline (GH-1394, GH-1395)

* Fix incorrect internal class number of Duktape.Thread.prototype; this had a
  cosmetic effect for Object.prototype.toString.call(Duktape.Thread.prototype)
  (GH-1402)

* Fix missing INCREF/DECREF for a thread's .resumer field which caused a
  mismatch between stored and computed refcounts (with assertions); the
  mismatch doesn't have functional effects however (GH-1407)

* Fix incorrect duk_tval_decref_norz() handling (called duk_heaphdr_decref()
  rather than duk_heaphdr_decref_norz()); however, this function is unused
  unless fast refcount handling is disabled explicitly (GH-1410)

2.0.3 (2017-05-04)
------------------

* Fix incorrect assert for RETCONSTN opcode when refcounting is disabled,
  actual behavior is correct however (GH-1432, GH-1433)

* Fix potentially stale duk_tval pointer in duk_inspect_value(), also affects
  Duktape.info() (GH-1453)

* Fix Symbol Object .valueOf() which returned the Symbol Object rather than
  the underlying plain Symbol (GH-1459)

* Fix RegExp group parsing to reject invalid groups like /(?Xabc)/, previously
  they were accepted silently (GH-1463)

* Fix potentially stale duk_tval pointer in Proxy deleteProperty handling
  (GH-1482)

* Fix missing duk_require_stack() in bound function call handling which caused
  calls to bound functions with a lot of bound arguments to fail with a value
  stack limit error (GH-1504)

* Fix duk_hbufobj assert in shared slice() handling (GH-1506)

2.1.0 (2017-04-15)
------------------

* Reorganize duktape.h #define/#include order so that duk_config.h now sees
  DUK_VERSION which allows e.g. application config fixups to react to Duktape
  version (GH-789, GH-1470)

* Replace heap string table algorithms (chain and probe) with a single
  algorithm based on single linked chaining of duk_hstrings, with the same
  algorithm serving both default and low memory environments; improve ROM
  string intern check (GH-1277, GH-1327)

* Replace object property table hash algorithm with a faster algorithm
  which uses a 2^N size and a bit mask instead of a prime size and a MOD;
  use a hash table more eagerly than before (GH-1284)

* Add ES2015 String.prototype.{startsWith,endsWith,includes}() (GH-1324,
  GH-1325, GH-1328)

* Add ES2015 Annex B HTML comment syntax (GH-1435, GH-1436, GH-1438)

* Allow ES2015 Annex B legacy octal escapes (\\1 to \\377) and literal digits
  (\\8 and \\9) for RegExp character classes (GH-1275, GH-1483)

* Add an experimental "global" property to the global object to provide easy
  access to the global object itself without needing idioms like
  "new Function('return this')()"; experimental, implemented based on
  https://github.com/tc39/proposal-global, enable using DUK_USE_GLOBAL_BINDING
  (GH-1259, GH-1260, GH-1441)

* Add non-standard shebang (#! ...) command syntax, allowed on first line of
  source if DUK_COMPILE_SHEBANG option is given to duk_compile() (GH-1380,
  GH-1346)

* Add shebang support to module-node (GH-1452)

* Add duk_opt_xxx() API calls which behave like duk_require_xxx() but allow a
  default value to be used when the index doesn't exist or the value is
  undefined (null is rejected with TypeError to mimic ES2015 optional
  arguments); for example: "int port = duk_opt_int(ctx, -3, 80);"
  (GH-1458)

* Add duk_get_xxx_default() API calls which behave like duk_get_xxx() but
  allow an explicit default value to be specified; for example:
  "int port = duk_get_int_default(ctx, -3, 80);" (GH-1472)

* Spawn the ArrayBuffer object backing a typed array lazily when its .buffer
  property is first read, reducing memory usage in common cases where the view
  is constructed directly without needing the ArrayBuffer object (GH-1225)

* Add a JSON.stringify() fast path for plain buffers (GH-1238)

* Improve duk_hstring array index handling performance when
  DUK_USE_HSTRING_ARRIDX is disabled (GH-1274)

* Improve duk_push_heapptr() assert validation to include checks that the
  pointer is only allowed in finalize_list or refzero_list if currently being
  finalized, and must otherwise be in either the string table (for strings)
  or heap_allocated (non-strings) (GH-1317)

* Minor improvements to heap object queue handling code: improve pointer
  compression performance a little, more assertion coverage (GH-1323)

* Make duk_hstring character length (clen) lazily computed to improve string
  handling performance for the majority of strings whose .length is never
  read (GH-1303, GH-1358)

* Improve lexical scope handling performance by adding internal duk_hdecenv
  and duk_hobjenv structures (previously generic objects were used) (GH-1310,
  GH-1339)

* Remove voluntary GC check from refzero processing; the check is not really
  necessary because all free operations decrement the voluntary GC counter and
  all allocs/reallocs check for voluntary GC (GH-1355)

* Remove voluntary GC trigger counter decrement from memory free calls; the
  decrement is unnecessary because alloc and free calls are ultimately in a
  rough balance and it suffices to update the counter in allocation only
  (GH-1427)

* Rework zero refcount (refzero) handling: memory frees triggered by a cascade
  of zero refcounts are now never postponed for objects that don't have a
  finalizer (and freeing the cascade has no side effects other than freeing
  blocks of memory) (GH-1427, GH-1454)

* Rework finalizer handling: always use the heap thread (heap->heap_thread)
  for finalizer calls, regardless of whether finalization is refcount or
  mark-and-sweep triggered; previously the current thread would be used for
  refcount finalization and current thread or heap thread (if no current
  thread exists) for mark-and-sweep finalization (GH-1427)

* Rework finalizer handling: if a mark-and-sweep triggered finalizer removes
  the object from a reference cycle so that its refcount is zero after
  finalizer execution, the object gets freed immediately rather than waiting
  for mark-and-sweep to confirm its status (GH-1427)

* Rework finalizer handling: finalizer execution is now outside of refzero
  processing and mark-and-sweep, and mark-and-sweep (but not recursive
  finalizer handling) is allowed during finalizer execution (GH-1427, GH-1451,
  GH-1457)

* Rework mark-and-sweep: include finalize_list in TEMPROOT marking; with
  duk_push_heapptr() allowed it's possible for application code to create
  a reference from heap_allocated to finalize_list and thus TEMPROOT flags
  for objects on finalize_list (GH-1455)

* Improve side effect protections: prevent finalizer execution between an
  error throw point and its catch point; add asserts for catching any cases
  where an error would be thrown when handling a previously thrown error
  (GH-314, GH-1311, GH-1427)

* Allow duk_push_heapptr() for a heap object which has become unreachable,
  has been queued to finalize_list, but hasn't yet been finalized; in this
  case duk_push_heapptr() cancels the finalization and moves the object back
  to the main heap_allocated list, in effect automatically rescuing the object
  without finalizer interaction (GH-1442)

* Use a 32-bit refcount field by default (even on 64-bit systems) which saves
  8 bytes for each heap object and can only wrap if the Duktape heap is
  larger than 64GB; disable DUK_USE_REFCOUNT32 to use size_t for refcounts
  (GH-1399, GH-1401)

* Duktape.Thread.prototype internal class is now Object rather than Thread;
  this is cosmetic and affects e.g. Object.prototype.toString.call() output
  for Duktape.Thread.prototype (but not Thread instances) (GH-1403)

* When assertions are enabled, compute comparison refcounts during
  mark-and-sweep and assert for matching refcounts for objects surviving
  the sweep phase (GH-1406)

* Avoid a harmless GC refcount assert when abandoning an object's array part
  (GH-1408)

* More assertion and torture test coverage for GC, finalizers, and error
  handling (GH-1411, GH-1427, GH-709)

* Avoid relying on the value stack when handling a double error (error which
  happened during handling of a previous error); this is cleaner but relying
  on value stack space should also be OK (GH-1415)

* Reject plain arguments to configure.py, they were previously ignored which
  allowed typos like "-DFOO bar" to be accepted silently (here as "-DFOO" and
  an ignored pain "bar" argument) (GH-1425)

* Add more self tests: fmod()+floor()+div splitting (GH-1657)

* Fix unintuitive refcount triggered finalizer behavior where a finalizer loop
  would happen if the finalizer created a (garbage) object referencing the
  object being finalized (GH-1396, GH-1427)

* Fix out-of-memory handling for object property table resize, previously
  an out-of-memory during property table resize could leave internal state
  in a state which prevented mark-and-sweep from fully working afterwards
  (GH-1426, GH-1427, GH-1650)

* Fix a garbage collection bug where a finalizer triggered by mark-and-sweep
  could cause a recursive entry into mark-and-sweep (leading to memory unsafe
  behavior) if the voluntary GC trigger counter dropped to zero during
  mark-and-sweep finalizer execution (GH-1347, GH-1355)

* Fix a garbage collection bug where a call into duk_gc() from a mark-and-sweep
  triggered finalizer could cause recursive entry into mark-and-sweep (leading
  memory unsafe behavior) (GH-1347)

* Fix a duk_push_heapptr() finalize_list assertion issue caused by the
  internal heap->finalize_list being (intentionally) out-of-sync during
  mark-and-sweep finalizer execution; this has no functional impact but
  breaks duk_push_heapptr() asserts in certain conditions (GH-1321)

* Fix a few incorrect asserts related to reference count triggered finalizer
  execution; the functionality itself was correct in these cases but a few
  asserts were too strict (GH-1318)

* Fix argument validation bug in typedarray .set() which would cause a segfault
  for e.g. new Float64Array(2).set(undefined) (GH-1285, GH-1286)

* Fix duk_hstring array index check integer overflow, which caused certain
  integer strings (such as '7394299990') to be incorrectly treated as array
  indices (GH-1273, GH-1276)

* Fix memory unsafe behavior in Duktape 2.0.0 String.prototype.repeat()
  (GH-1270)

* Fix incorrect behavior for new TextEncoder().encode('') (applied to an
  empty string) which manifested at least on MSVC (GH-1293, GH-1294)

* Fix incorrect exponentiation operator behavior which happened at least on
  Linux gcc 4.8.4 with -O2 (not -Os) (GH-1272)

* Fix ROM pointer duk_heaphdr_incref() handling when slow refcount default
  was enabled (GH-1320)

* Fix bug in global object environment "provideThis" attribute when using ROM
  objects and DUK_USE_ROM_GLOBAL_INHERIT (GH-1340, GH-1310)

* Fix bug in global/eval code variable redeclaration handling where a
  plain 'var X;' redeclaration for an existing binding caused 'undefined' to
  overwrite the existing binding rather than being treated as a no-op
  (GH-1351, GH-1354)

* Fix some stale activation ('act') pointer handling which could lead to
  memory unsafe behavior in some cases (GH-1370, GH-1371, GH-1373)

* Fix duk_is_constructor_call() for an empty callstack (GH-1376)

* Fix debugger Throw notify handling for an empty callstack (e.g. error
  thrown by duk_throw() with nothing on the callstack) (GH-1377)

* Fix 'duk' command line bytecode load error (GH-1333, GH-1334)

* Fix duk_error_raw() compile warning with -Wmissing-prototypes (GH-1390)

* Fix module-duktape and module-node handling of a module source which has
  a // comment on the last line without a trailing newline (GH-1394, GH-1395)

* Fix incorrect internal class number of Duktape.Thread.prototype; this had a
  cosmetic effect for Object.prototype.toString.call(Duktape.Thread.prototype)
  (GH-1402)

* Fix missing INCREF/DECREF for a thread's .resumer field which caused a
  mismatch between stored and computed refcounts (with assertions); the
  mismatch doesn't have functional effects however (GH-1407)

* Fix incorrect duk_tval_decref_norz() handling (called duk_heaphdr_decref()
  rather than duk_heaphdr_decref_norz()); however, this function is unused
  unless fast refcount handling is disabled explicitly (GH-1410)

* Fix alignment increase warning with clang (GH-1430, GH-1431)

* Fix incorrect assert for RETCONSTN opcode when refcounting is disabled,
  actual behavior is correct however (GH-1432, GH-1433)

* Fix potentially stale duk_tval pointer in duk_inspect_value(), also affects
  Duktape.info() (GH-1453)

* Fix Symbol Object .valueOf() which returned the Symbol Object rather than
  the underlying plain Symbol (GH-1459)

* Fix RegExp group parsing to reject invalid groups like /(?Xabc)/, previously
  they were accepted silently (GH-1463)

* Fix potentially stale duk_tval pointer in Proxy deleteProperty handling
  (GH-1482)

* Avoid log2(), log10(), cbrt(), and trunc() on Android and Atari MiNT
  (GH-1325, GH-1341, GH-1430, GH-1431)

* Portability improvements for Solaris, HPUX, and AIX (GH-1356)

* Portability improvements for Durango (XboxOne) (GH-1386, GH-1387, GH-1389)

* Portability improvements for Nspire (GH-1461)

* Portability improvements for MIPS platforms, change alignment requirement
  of MIPS32 from 4 to 8 (GH-1478, GH-1479)

* Compiler warning fix for using DUK_UNREF() on a volatile argument (GH-1282)

* Add DUK_HOT() and DUK_COLD() macros, and use them for a few internal
  functions (GH-1297)

* Add assertion coverage for INCREF refcount wrapping (GH-1400)

* Miscellaneous compiler warning fixes (GH-1358)

* Use _snprintf() prior to MSVC 2015 in extras/module-duktape (GH-1369,
  GH-1385)

* Miscellaneous performance improvements: more likely/unlike attributes and
  hot/cold function splits (GH-1308, GH-1309, GH-1312), integer
  refzero-free-running flag (instead of a flag bit) (GH-1362), faster GC
  finalizer existence check using DUK_HOBJECT_FLAG_HAVE_FINALIZER (GH-1398),
  faster skipping of sub-struct checks in DECREF/mark-and-sweep (GH-1403)

* Miscellaneous footprint improvements: more compact duk_hobject allocation
  (GH-1357), explicit thr->callstack_curr field for current activation
  (GH-1372), avoid DUK_COMPILE_xxx flag translation internally (GH-1450)

* Internal change: duk_hstring now has a 'next' heap pointer for string table
  chaining; this affects string allocation sizes which may matter for manually
  tuned memory pools (GH-1277)

2.1.1 (2017-07-29)
------------------

* Fix missing duk_require_stack() in bound function call handling which caused
  calls to bound functions with a lot of bound arguments to fail with a value
  stack limit error (GH-1504)

* Fix duk_hbufobj assert in shared slice() handling (GH-1506)

* Fix MSVC cast warning in error augmentation code (GH-1511)

* Fix incorrect .length behavior for function templates loaded by
  duk_load_function() (GH-1513, GH-1516)

* Fix Reflect.construct() handling for four or more arguments (GH-1517,
  GH-1518)

* Fix duk_check_stack_top() and duk_require_stack_top() internal value stack
  reserve calculation which failed to take into account call stack entries
  below the current call, leading potentially to a smaller reserve than
  requested (GH-1536)

* Fix potential segfault in debugger GetHeapObjInfo command, caused by
  key/mask list being out of sync (GH-1540)

* Fix duk_pcall_prop(), duk_safe_call(), and duk_pnew() argument validation,
  in some cases a negative nargs/nrets argument (which is always invalid)
  could be accepted (GH-1553)

* Fix incorrect lookahead in RegExp class range dash ('-') parsing which
  caused RegExp classes ending in a dash (e.g. [abc-]) to be handled
  incorrectly (GH-1569, GH-1570)

* Fix incorrect handling of register bound unary operation target for
  unary minus, unary plus, and bitwise NOT (GH-1623, GH-1624)

2.1.2 (2018-04-22)
------------------

* Improve error message for instanceof and duk_instanceof() when rval has
  no .prototype property, which is common for Duktape/C functions (GH-1725)

* Fix pointer size detection for MSVC2015 ARM32/ARM64 (GH-1577, GH-1675)

* Fix incorrect pausing by debugger StepOut, StepOver, and StepInto commands
  when stepping out/over/into a tail call (GH-1684, GH-1685, GH-1726, GH-1734)

* Fix dangling pointer in instanceof/duk_instanceof() when rval .prototype is
  a virtualized property coming from a getter or a Proxy trap (GH-1725)

* Fix trailing single line comment handling for Function constructor;
  new Function('return "foo" //') previously failed with SyntaxError
  (GH-1757)

* Fix potential dangling pointer use in Duktape thread termination handling;
  the dangling pointer could cause unsafe memory behavior (GH-1845, GH-1868)

2.2.0 (2017-09-23)
------------------

* Change inheritance for Duktape/C user functions pushed using
  duk_push_c_function() and duk_push_c_lightfunc(), they now inherit from an
  intermediate prototype object (function -> %NativeFunctionPrototype% ->
  Function.prototype) which provides .name and .length getters; the virtual
  .name and .length properties of Duktape/C and lightfuncs have been removed;
  this change also allows .name and .length to be overridden using
  duk_def_prop() or Object.defineProperty() (GH-1493, GH-1494, GH-1515)

* Add Object.prototype.{__defineGetter__,__defineSetter__} and
  Object.prototype.{__lookupGetter__,__lookupSetter__} from ES2017 Annex B,
  they are also used by a lot of existing legacy code (GH-1531, GH-1551)

* Add ES2015 Math.clz32(), Math.imul(), and Math.sign() (GH-1561)

* Handle Function.prototype.call(), Function.prototype.apply(),
  Reflect.apply(), and Reflect.construct() inline in call handling; as a side
  effect .call(), .apply(), and .construct() no longer appear in the call stack
  (tracebacks etc) (GH-1421, GH-1522, GH-1545, GH-1557)

* Function.prototype.call(), Function.prototype.apply(), Reflect.apply(),
  and Reflect.construct() can now be used in tailcalls (e.g.
  'return func.call(null, 123);'), don't grow the native C stack when doing an
  ECMAScript-to-ECMAScript call, and no longer prevent coroutine yielding
  (GH-1421, GH-1545, GH-1557)

* Constructor calls (new Func()) can be used in tailcalls, don't grow
  the native C stack when doing an ECMAScript-to-ECMAScript call, and no
  longer prevent coroutine yielding (GH-1523)

* Increase maximum call argument count from 255 to ~64k (GH-1292, GH-1586)

* Improve error message for property-based call TypeError (e.g. foo.noSuch()),
  error message now includes the key for easier debugging (GH-1627, GH-1630,
  GH-1631, GH-1644, GH-1645, GH-1750)

* Add duk_{get,put,has,del}_prop_heapptr() API calls for faster property
  manipulation when a borrowed heap pointer (typically string) is available
  (GH-1703)

* Add duk_seal() and duk_freeze() API calls, equivalent to Object.seal()
  and Object.freeze() (GH-1594)

* Add duk_is_constructable() API call (GH-1523)

* Add duk_require_object() API call for consistency (GH-1731, GH-1732)

* Add duk_push_proxy() API call which allows a Proxy to be created from C
  code (GH-1500, GH-837, GH-1680)

* Accept an ArrayBuffer as an argument to duk_push_buffer_object() when
  creating a view (anything other than an ArrayBuffer) (GH-1236, GH-1710)

* Add DUK_HIDDEN_SYMBOL(), DUK_GLOBAL_SYMBOL(), DUK_LOCAL_SYMBOL(), and
  DUK_WELLKNOWN_SYMBOL() macros for creating symbol literals (GH-1673)

* Change Duktape internal hidden Symbols to use the 0x82 byte prefix,
  freeing the 0xFF prefix entirely to application use; there are no longer
  restrictions on what follows the 0xFF prefix (GH-1721)

* Change initial bytecode format byte from 0xFF to 0xBF to avoid potential
  to confuse a user hidden Symbol with bytecode, and remove unnecessary
  bytecode serialization version byte (GH-1733)

* Change duk_bool_t type to unsigned integer (previously signed integer)
  and make DUK_TYPE_xxx, DUK_TYPE_MASK_xxx, and flags constants unsigned
  in the API header (GH-1688)

* Add more convenience flag defines for duk_def_prop(), e.g.
  DUK_DEFPROP_ATTR_WC sets writable and configurable, and clears
  enumerable (GH-1208)

* Add support for Proxy 'apply' and 'construct' traps (GH-1601)

* Add minimal new.target support; new.target evaluates to undefined for
  non-constructor calls and to the final non-bound constructor function in
  constructor calls; explicit newTarget not yet supported and handling of
  new.target in eval() code is not yet fully correct (GH-1544, GH-1572)

* Add proper string vs. symbol sorting to Reflect.ownKeys() and other
  enumeration call sites (GH-1460, GH-1607)

* Add an internal type for representing Proxy instances (duk_hproxy) to
  simplify Proxy operations and improve performance (GH-1500, GH-1136)

* Add an internal type for representing bound functions (duk_hboundfunc) and
  "collapse" bound function chains so that the target of a duk_hboundfunc is
  always a non-bound function (GH-1503, GH-1507, GH-1748)

* Make call stack and value stack limits configurable via config options
  (DUK_USE_CALLSTACK_LIMIT, DUK_USE_VALSTACK_LIMIT) (GH-1526)

* Add a wrap check to duk_{check,require}_stack{_top}() (GH-1537)

* Improve case insensitive RegExp character class compilation performance
  using a small (256 byte, total footprint impact is about 300-400 bytes)
  canonicalization lookup bitmap (GH-1616)

* Improve error messages for source code, base-64, hex, UTF-8, and bytecode
  encoding/decoding (GH-1738)

* Add better symbol summary for e.g. error messages, "[Symbol global '?foo']"
  instead of just "'?foo'" (GH-1643)

* Make fatal error message formatting buffer longer for uncaught errors
  (64 -> 128 bytes) and make it configurable via DUK_USE_FATAL_MAXLEN
  (GH-1652)

* Make error message summary strings longer (32 -> 96 character) to better
  capture error messages for e.g. uncaught errors (GH-1653)

* Improve error message for instanceof and duk_instanceof() when rval has
  no .prototype property, which is common for Duktape/C functions (GH-1725)

* Add an explicit buffer size wrap check for Buffer.concat() (GH-1688)

* Reject an attempt to unpack an array with >= 2G elements cleanly with a
  RangeError rather than failing during the process (GH-1688)

* Add DUK_USE_GET_MONOTONIC_TIME() to allow an application to provide a
  monotonic time source (similar to clock_gettime() CLOCK_MONOTONIC) which
  Duktape will then use for performance.now() and internal rate limiting
  mechanisms; if absent (default), monotonic time defaults to
  DUK_USE_DATE_GET_NOW() (GH-1659)

* Add monotonic time provider for Windows based on QueryPerformanceCounter(),
  enabled by default if _WIN32_WINNT indicates Vista or above (GH-1662)

* Add monotonic time provider for Unix platforms using clock_gettime() and
  CLOCK_MONOTONIC time source; the time provider is disabled by default, enable
  using -DDUK_USE_GET_MONOTONIC_TIME_CLOCK_GETTIME (GH-1667)

* Use monotonic time (if available) for debugger transport peeking, so that
  the peek callback is called with the same realtime rate even if the
  ECMAScript time source jumps or doesn't advance in realtime (GH-1659)

* Allow sub-millisecond resolution for DUK_USE_DATE_GET_NOW() Date provider;
  the extra resolution is visible through duk_get_now() but not through Date
  instances because ECMAScript requires Date instances to have integer
  millisecond timestamps (GH-773, GH-1660, GH-1669)

* Add sub-millisecond resolution to the default POSIX and Windows Date
  providers (DUK_USE_DATE_GET_NOW); Windows sub-millisecond resolution
  is available if _WIN32_WINNT indicates Windows 8 or above (GH-1660, GH-1664)

* Add an initial version of the High Resolution Time API, providing
  performance.now() (which backs to DUK_USE_GET_MONOTONIC_TIME() if
  available); performance.timeOrigin is intentionally absent for now,
  until semantics are decided for Duktape (GH-1660)

* Change Unix time provider to tolerate (unlikely) gettimeofday() errors
  without throwing, as internals are not always expecting to deal with an
  error when reading current time (GH-1666)

* Add assertion coverage for catching calls into Duktape API from debug
  transport calls (read, peek, etc) (GH-1681)

* Remove license.spdx from the distributable (GH-1741)

* Fix incorrect handling of register bound unary operation target for
  unary minus, unary plus, and bitwise NOT (GH-1623, GH-1624)

* Fix incorrect lookahead in RegExp class range dash ('-') parsing which
  caused RegExp classes ending in a dash (e.g. [abc-]) to be handled
  incorrectly (GH-1569, GH-1570)

* Fix duk_pcall_prop(), duk_safe_call(), and duk_pnew() argument validation,
  in some cases a negative nargs/nrets argument (which is always invalid)
  could be accepted (GH-1553)

* Fix potential segfault in debugger GetHeapObjInfo command, caused by
  key/mask list being out of sync (GH-1540)

* Fix dangling pointer in instanceof/duk_instanceof() when rval .prototype is
  a virtualized property coming from a getter or a Proxy trap (GH-1725)

* Fix Reflect.construct() handling for four or more arguments (GH-1517,
  GH-1518)

* Fix callstack limit bumping for errThrow augmentation calls, the limit might
  be bumped and unbumped for different Duktape threads if coroutines were
  resumed/yielded in the process; this is relatively harmless but might cause
  an errThrow augmentation call to fail due to callstack limit being reached
  (GH-1490)

* Fix incorrect .length behavior for function templates loaded by
  duk_load_function(), caused by not distinguishing between a missing and a
  zero length _Formals array (GH-1513, GH-1516)

* Fix missing duk_require_stack() in bound function call handling which caused
  calls to bound functions with a lot of bound arguments to fail with a value
  stack limit error (GH-1504)

* Fix duk_check_stack_top() and duk_require_stack_top() internal value stack
  reserve calculation which failed to take into account call stack entries
  below the current call, leading potentially to a smaller reserve than
  requested (GH-1536)

* Fix incorrect pausing by debugger StepOut, StepOver, and StepInto commands
  when stepping out/over/into a tail call (GH-1684, GH-1685, GH-1726, GH-1734)

* Fix duk_hbufobj assert in shared slice() handling (GH-1506)

* Fix internal debug print opcode name list which was out of sync with previous
  changes (GH-1509)

* Fix MSVC cast warning in error augmentation code (GH-1511)

* Fix duk_debug.js --source-dirs scanning for file dropdown; the dropdown was
  empty (GH-1580)

* Fix some compile warnings for duk_error() and duk_throw() in duk_cmdline.c,
  module-duktape, module-node, and duk-v1-compat extras (GH-1646)

* Fix harmless GCC 7 -Wextra warning in Date built-in (GH-1646)

* Fix -Wsign-conversion warnings for GCC / Clang (GH-1688)

* Fix Clang -Wshorten-64-to-32 warnings and an incorrect uninitialized
  variable warning (GH-1735)

* Fix pointer size detection for MSVC2015 ARM32/ARM64 (GH-1577, GH-1675)

* Improve support for old MSVC versions without __pragma(), long long, and
  LL/ULL constants (GH-1559, GH-1562)

* Simplify handling of ENDFIN opcode a bit (GH-1508)

* Rework value stack grow/shrink handling; value stack is now grown when
  calling a function or reserving value stack space explicitly and only
  shrunk in mark-and-sweep (GH-1526)

* Remove automatic value stack reserve check from duk_safe_call() to
  ensure 'nrets' return values fit into the value stack; the check was not
  guaranteed by the API and is mostly unnecessary (GH-1552)

* Add some statistics dumps to mark-and-sweep with debug logging enabled
  (GH-1579, GH-1640, GH-1677)

* Add DUK_CONSOLE_FLUSH flag to extras/console (GH-1587, GH-1588)

* Use stdout for info and below, and stderr for warn and above in
  extras/console; previous behavior was to use stdout only, use
  DUK_CONSOLE_STDOUT_ONLY init flag to restore previous behavior (GH-1890,
  GH-1903)

* Compile warning fix to extras/console (GH-1906)

* Compile warning fixes and Duktape 1.x compatibility fix to module-node
  (GH-1605)

* Add print(), console.log() etc bindings to Makefile.dukdebug (GH-1535,
  GH-1593)

* Internal change: use duk_hthread instead of duk_context in all internal
  code, removing unnecessary and awkward ctx <-> thr casts (GH-1614)

* Internal change: set REACHABLE for all READONLY objects (relevant when
  using ROM built-ins) so that mark-and-sweep doesn't need an explicit
  READONLY check (GH-1502)

* Internal change: duk_activation structs are now in a single linked list
  attached to a duk_hthread instead of being a separate, monolithic
  thr->callstack (GH-1487)

* Internal change: duk_catcher structs are now in a single linked list
  attached to a duk_activation instead of being a separate, monolithic
  thr->catchstack (GH-1449)

* Internal change: simple freelists for duk_activation and duk_catcher
  (GH-1491)

* Internal change: terminology, use 'slack' rather than 'spare' (GH-1615)

* Internal change: DUK_ASSERT_API_ENTRY() assertion for later use (GH-1642)

* Internal change: add a non-functional Promise placeholder, disabled by
  default (GH-1672)

* Miscellaneous footprint improvements: rework call handling to improve
  code sharing (GH-1552, GH-1749); optional lazy charlen (GH-1337); remove
  'thr' argument from Date 'now' providers (GH-1666); prune some objects from
  thr->bidx[] array (GH-1668)

* Miscellaneous performance improvements: move rare/large opcodes into
  NOINLINE helpers (GH-1510); duk_harray fast path for internal array
  unpack for bound functions, .call, and .apply (GH-1525); unsafe internal
  value stack pops where safe (GH-1583, GH-1584); initial object property
  table size estimates for NEWOBJ and NEWARR opcodes (object and array
  literals) (GH-1596, GH-1597); duk_concat_2() internal helper for str+str
  arithmetic (GH-1599); larger spare for bufwriter in non-lowmem build
  (GH-1611); faster internal duk_to_number_tval() (GH-1612); minor
  optimizations to duk_is_callable() and duk_is_constructable() (GH-1631);
  check entry part before array part in property lookup (GH-1634); optimize
  duk_propdesc filling in property lookups (GH-1635)

2.2.1 (2018-04-26)
------------------

* Fix trailing single line comment handling for Function constructor;
  new Function('return "foo" //') previously failed with SyntaxError
  (GH-1757)

* Fix DUK_BOOL_{MIN,MAX} defines for unsigned duk_bool_t (GH-1769)

* Fix debugger StepOver behavior when a tailcall happens in a nested
  function (not the function where stepping started from) (GH-1786, GH-1787)

* Fix potential dangling pointer use in Duktape thread termination handling;
  the dangling pointer could cause unsafe memory behavior (GH-1845, GH-1868)

2.3.0 (2018-08-04)
------------------

* When C++ exception support is enabled use a separate duk_fatal_exception
  (inherits from std::runtime_error) to propagate fatal errors (uncaught
  errors, assertions) out of Duktape when using the default fatal error
  handler (GH-1915)

* Update UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt used for building internal
  Unicode control data to Unicode version 10.0.0 (GH-1851)

* Add support for Symbol.hasInstance (@@hasInstance) check for 'instanceof'
  operator and duk_instanceof() API call; also add Symbol.hasInstance and
  Function.prototype[@@hasInstance] (GH-1821)

* Add support for Symbol.toStringTag (@@toStringTag) in
  Object.prototype.toString() (GH-1822)

* Add support for Symbol.isConcatSpreadable (@@isConcatSpreadable) in
  Array.prototype.concat() (GH-1823)

* Add support for Symbol.toPrimitive (@@toPrimitive) in ToPrimitive()
  internal algorithm and duk_to_primitive() API call (GH-1825)

* Invoke Proxy 'has' trap in Array.prototype.concat() when inspecting the
  elements of the Proxy target (GH-1823)

* Remove DUK_USE_NONSTD_ARRAY_CONCAT_TRAILER because the underlying ES5.1
  specification "bug" was fixed in ES2015 (GH-1823)

* Remove DUK_USE_NONSTD_ARRAY_MAP_TRAILER because ES5.0/ES5.1 behavior
  actually did match the "non-standard" behavior provided by the option
  (GH-1823)

* Add duk_random() to allow C code access to the same random number source
  as ECMAScript code (GH-1815)

* Add duk_push_new_target() to allow C code to access new.target; at present
  this is for completeness because without actual class support it's only
  useful to detect constructor calls which can already be done using
  duk_is_constructor_call() (GH-1745)

* Add experimental API call variants for plain C literals, for example
  duk_push_literal(ctx, "key") and duk_get_prop_literal(ctx, "propname"),
  which allow e.g. better performance; calls added: duk_push_literal(),
  duk_get_prop_literal(), duk_put_prop_literal(), duk_has_prop_literal(),
  duk_del_prop_literal(), duk_get_global_literal(), duk_put_global_literal()
  (GH-1805)

* Add duk_get_global_heapptr() and duk_put_global_heapptr() for completeness
  (GH-1805)

* Automatically pin strings accessed using the C literal API call variants
  such as duk_get_prop_literal(ctx, "propname") between mark-and-sweep rounds
  to facilitate literal caching and to reduce string table traffic; this
  behavior can be disabled by disabling DUK_USE_LITCACHE_SIZE in configure.py
  (GH-1813)

* Add a lookup cache for C literals to speed up string table lookups when
  using API call variants such as duk_get_prop_literal(ctx, "propname");
  the cache relies on literals being pinned between mark-and-sweep rounds,
  and can be disabled by disabling DUK_USE_LITCACHE_SIZE in configure.py
  (GH-1813)

* ES2015 Number constructor properties: EPSILON, MIN_SAFE_INTEGER,
  MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, isFinite(), isInteger(), isNaN(), isSafeInteger(),
  parseInt(), parseFloat() (GH-1756, GH-1761)

* Assume only natural alignment (DUK_USE_ALIGN_BY=8) on all platforms to
  minimize compiler assumptions regarding unaligned accesses (which can be
  an issue even on x86); applications working with a low memory target may
  want to force DUK_USE_ALIGN_BY in configuration (GH-1783, GH-1784)

* Base64 decoder is now more lenient for padding: accepts missing padding
  ('Zm'), partial padding ('Zm='), standard padding ('Zm=='), and extra
  padding ('Zm===' etc), also for concatenated documents ('Zm===Zm' decodes
  to 'ff' for example) (GH-1789)

* Base64 encoder and decoder performance improvements for both fast path and
  slow path variants (GH-1789)

* Make base64 support optional and drop it from lowmem base configuration;
  define DUK_USE_BASE64_SUPPORT to enable it (GH-1789)

* Make hex support optional and drop it from lowmem base configuration;
  define DUK_USE_BASE64_SUPPORT to enable it (GH-1789)

* Add C++ name mangling wrappers (extern "C") for extras (GH-1780, GH-1782)

* Add a duk_uint64_t to duk_hbuffer_fixed forced alignment union trick just
  in case double and uint64_t alignment requirements differ (GH-1799)

* Add a CBOR encoder/decoder as an extra (GH-1781, GH-1800, GH-1801)

* Add a minimal ES2015 Promise polyfill into the distribution (GH-1865)

* Include <exception> only when compiling as C++ with C++ exception support
  enabled (GH-1838, GH-1839)

* Allow undefined timeout in eventloop example setTimeout() and setInterval()
  bindings, minor cleanups and improvements (GH-1866, GH-1879, GH-1884)

* Revise Number.prototype.toFixed() 'this' binding and fractionDigits argument
  validation order to match ES2015 where the 'this' binding is validated
  first (GH-1887)

* Add Makefile.jsoncbor to the distributable (GH-1885)

* Makefile.sharedlibrary portability improvements (GH-1922, GH-1923)

* Change spelling to "ECMAScript" throughout the internal source code; as
  far as external behavior is concerned this only affects a few debug prints
  (GH-1894)

* Fix NULL pointer dereference in error augmentation when DUK_USE_TRACEBACKS
  was disabled (GH-1909)

* Fix potential dangling pointer use in Duktape thread termination handling;
  the dangling pointer could cause unsafe memory behavior (GH-1845, GH-1868)

* Fix performance.now() property attributes to 'wec' (earlier 'wc') (GH-1821)

* Fix debugger StepOver behavior when a tailcall happens in a nested
  function (not the function where stepping started from) (GH-1786, GH-1787)

* Fix trailing single line comment handling for Function constructor;
  new Function('return "foo" //') previously failed with SyntaxError
  (GH-1757)

* Fix some lexer bugs related to parsing in RegExp mode (interpret leading
  '/' as part of a RegExp) or not (interpret '/' as division) (GH-1779)

* Fix DUK_BOOL_{MIN,MAX} defines for unsigned duk_bool_t (GH-1769)

* Fix 'defined but not used' warning for Windows (GH-1775)

* Fix potential uninitialized data use when Windows Date provider
  FileTimeToSystemTime() or FileTimeToLocalFileTime() failed (GH-1953)

* Fix some Clang warnings by avoiding undefined behavior by default, define
  DUK_USE_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR to reduce the explicit undefined behavior
  checks for better footprint/performance (GH-1777, GH-1795, GH-1796, GH-1797,
  GH-1798)

* Fix some compilation warnings triggered when DUK_NORETURN is not defined;
  the internal DUK_WO_NORETURN() is used to include unreachable dummy
  statements when the noreturn attribute is not available, e.g.
  DUK_WO_NORETURN(return 0;); (GH-1790)

* Fix a few casts in duk_trans_socket_windows.c to avoid errors in a C++
  build (GH-1773)

* Fix harmless -Wcast-align warnings on armhf (GH-1793)

* Various compiler warning fixes (GH-1788, GH-1932, GH-1924, GH-1950,
  GH-1951, etc)

* Add automatic workaround for union aliasing issues with FreeBSD + -m32 +
  Clang prior to 5.0; the aliasing issues cause packed duk_tval to work
  incorrectly (see
  https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/misc/clang_aliasing.c),
  and the workaround is to use unpacked duk_tval prior to Clang 5.0 (GH-1764)

2.4.0 (2019-07-28)
------------------

* Add duk_to_stacktrace() and duk_safe_to_stacktrace() to make it easier to
  get stacktraces in C code (GH-2059, GH-2086)

* Add duk_push_bare_array() to push an Array instance which doesn't
  inherit from anything (GH-2064)

* Add duk_require_constructable() and duk_require_constructor_call() to
  the public API (previously they were internal helpers) (GH-2102)

* Enable Symbol built-in by default (DUK_USE_SYMBOL_BUILTIN) (GH-1969)

* Remove arguments.caller for strict argument objects to match revised
  ES2017 behavior (GH-2009)

* Add DUK_USE_NATIVE_STACK_CHECK() macro config option (disabled by default)
  for a platform specific stack space check in recursive and stack heavy
  code paths; this is more accurate than the default fixed recursion limit
  (GH-1995)

* When using Proxy wrapping in console extra, don't return a fake NOP
  function for console.toJSON to avoid confusing JX serialization of the
  console object (GH-2052, GH-2054, GH-2055)

* Disable Proxy wrapper for 'duk' console binding because it is no longer
  the preferred console implementation method (GH-2055)

* Update UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt used for building internal
  Unicode control data to Unicode version 12.1.0 (GH-2085)

* Use bare objects/arrays in more places internally: variable map and
  formals array of functions loaded from bytecode (to match behavior of
  compiled functions), context dump array for duk_push_context_dump(),
  and error tracedata (GH-2089)

* Expose DUK_INTERNAL_SYMBOL() macro; while an application shouldn't
  normally need to use this macro at all, it may be useful in some cases
  to peek into Duktape internals (with no versioning guarantees) (GH-2118)

* Accept non-plain buffer types in some examples/extras (cmdline, eventloop,
  logging, print-alert) (GH-2107)

* Fix eventloop example .write() method buffer handling which relied on
  Duktape.Buffer, also fix a related TCP client example bug (GH-2107)

* Minor changes to CBOR extra type handling: encode non-UTF-8 strings
  as CBOR byte strings (instead of text strings), encode Symbols as empty
  objects, refuse to decode Symbols, encode pointers as "(%p)" instead of
  "%p" to match JX, decode integers in most cases to fastints when possible
  (GH-2121, GH-2154)

* Minor performance improvements to CBOR extra (GH-2121, GH-2154)

* Add (untested) support for mixed endian targets to CBOR extra (GH-2121)

* Remove support for unnecessary DUK_USE_USER_DECLARE config option, use
  configure.py fixup line/file instead (GH-2123)

* Remove ncurses dependency from the eventloop example, add a new example
  for running a lot of timers, improve init error reporting (GH-2126,
  GH-2128)

* Add --no-auto-complete option to 'duk' to disable linenoise auto
  completion (GH-2131)

* Add support for keeping an array's internal array part in
  Object.defineProperty(), previously the array part was always
  abandoned if an array index was defined using Object.defineProperty()
  (even if property attributes were correct) (GH-2146)

* Rework some internal property handling call sites and helpers to e.g.
  avoid inheriting internal properties when not intended (GH-2149)

* Improve assertion coverage for internal structures during mark-and-sweep
  (GH-2092)

* Fix incorrect parsing of post-increment/post-decrement followed by
  division (e.g. "z++ / 20"), the slash was interpreted as beginning
  a regexp (GH-2140)

* Fix incorrect handling of zero-length dynamic buffer in base-64 fast path
  decoder (GH-2027, GH-2088)

* Fix Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() behavior for the virtual properties
  of arrays, Strings, and buffer objects: string keys were incorrectly
  included in the result (GH-1978, GH-1979)

* Fix Date .setTime(), setYear(), etc behavior for a frozen Date instance;
  they should be allowed, but were rejected with a TypeError (GH-2149)

* Fix compile error (missing DUK_DCERROR_UNSUPPORTED macro) when compiling
  with RegExp support disabled (GH-1990, GH-1991)

* Fix configure.py -D option to accept parenthesized macros, e.g.
  '-DFOO(bar)=quux', which were used in some examples but were not
  actually functional (GH-2013, GH-2014)

* Fix error handling corner case when a property-based call (foo.bar())
  caused an error and Duktape.errCreate returned a callable value (such
  as Float64Array); this caused an assertion failure (GH-2061, GH-2087)

* Fix coercion of +'+' and +'-' to NaN instead of 0 (GH-2019, GH-2134)

* Fix possible out-of-memory in call stack unwind by preallocating the
  environment property table on creation (GH-476, GH-2021, GH-2106)

* Fix possibility for unbounded native recursion without call stack limit
  backstop when call handling triggers a Proxy trap (GH-2032, GH-2108)

* Fix several assertion failures with possible memory unsafe behavior
  (GH-2022, GH-2023, GH-2024, GH-2025, GH-2026, GH-2031, GH-2033, GH-2035,
  GH-2036, GH-2065, GH-2115, GH-2138, GH-2146)

* Fix incorrect assertion with no underlying bug for resolving bound
  function chains with a Proxy object (rather than a plain function)
  as the final non-bound function (GH-2049, GH-2103)

* Fix incorrect assertion with no underlying bug for "thr == heap_thread"
  during heap destruction finalizer runs; the assert is untrue when a
  finalizer (executed during heap destruction) resumes a coroutine (GH-2030,
  GH-2132, GH-2133)

* Fix compile error for extras/eventloop due to missing a header file
  (c_eventloop.h) in the dist package (GH-2090)

* Fix CBOR decoding of text strings and byte strings with a lot of
  concatenated pieces in the CBOR extra (GH-2093)

* Fix CBOR decoding of (ignored) 64-bit tags in the CBOR extra (GH-2095)

* Fix a CBOR encoding wrap check in the CBOR extra (GH-2121)

* Trivial fixes and cleanups: Windows Date provider return code check
  consistency (GH-1956)

* Fix MSVC ARM64 detection (GH-2078)

* Use GCC (>= 5.0) and Clang builtin bswap macros, add internal DUK_BSWAP64()
  macro (GH-2122)

* Short term workaround for a noreturn-related issue with GCC 5+ (GH-2155)
  where some internal duk_require_constructor_call() calls are entirely
  missing in compiler output in certain circumstances (GCC 5+, noreturn
  attributes enabled, debugger support enabled); the workaround is to
  disable noreturn macros for GCC 5+ for now (GH-2156)

* Various portability fixes (GH-1931, GH-1976)

2.5.0 (2019-11-24)
------------------

* Rename the 'global' binding to 'globalThis' to match updated
  proposal-global; enable the binding by default; update
  polyfills/global.js (GH-2160)

* Add duk_pull() API call (GH-2184)

* Add experimental duk_cbor_encode() and duk_cbor_decode() API calls (GH-2163)

* Move CBOR extra into an actual Duktape built-in, enabled by default (GH-2163)

* Include "end of input" in error message if SyntaxError occurs at end of
  file (GH-2152, GH-2165)

* Add missing DUK_DEFPROP_xxx convenience constants for the 'EC' combination
  (like DUK_DEFPROP_EC, DUK_DEFPROP_HAVE_EC, etc) which were accidentally
  missing from the API header (GH-2187)

* Fix behavior of proxied Array objects for: Array.isArray(), duk_is_array(),
  Object.prototype.toString(), JSON.stringify(), Array.prototype.concat()
  (GH-2041, GH-2175, GH-2176)

* Fix a harmless assert in Math.atan2() when compiling with gcc -m32 (GH-2164)

* Fix (suppress) -Wfloat-equal warnings for GCC and Clang (GH-234, GH-2164)

* Fix compile warning when base64 support disabled (GH-2159)

* Fix some compile warnings (GH-2161, GH-2172)

* Add RISC-V architecture detection in duk_config.h; previous versions
  also compiled on RISC-V but identified as "generic" (GH-2174)

* Avoid ast/endian.h header on Solaris (GH-2180)

* Minor performance and footprint improvements (GH-2167, GH-2177)

Planned
=======

3.0.0 (XXXX-XX-XX)
------------------

* Remove prepared source variants other than src/ (matches Duktape 2.x
  src-noline/) from the distributable (GH-2209)

* Accept unlabelled function statements outside of top level for strict
  functions (using hoist semantics), previously they were rejected with
  a SyntaxError (GH-2213)
