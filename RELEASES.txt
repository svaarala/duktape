Released
========

* Most built-ins incomplete or missing

0.2.0 (2013-02-27)
------------------

* Built-ins implemented: Boolean, Date, JSON

* Date built-in has initial, minimal local time / locale support

* Initial internal documentation: regexp, datetime, json

0.3.0 (2013-03-16)
------------------

* Built-ins implemented: global object, Object, String

0.4.0 (2013-03-31)
------------------

0.5.0 (2013-05-17)
------------------

* Built-in number conversion primitives

* Cleanup built-ins, improve test cases for built-ins

0.6.0 (2013-09-21)
------------------

* First round of public API cleanup, and add basic API documentation

* First version of duktape.org website

0.7.0 (2013-10-30)
------------------

* Traceback support improved

* Clean up and document error object properties

* Add prototype objects for buffer and pointer values, and make them object
  coercible

* Proper support for big, little, and "middle endian" environments

* Single file combined source distributable

* Portability and bug fixes

0.8.0 (2013-12-18)
------------------

* Remove DUK_PROFILE model, explicit DUK_OPT_xxx feature options added for
  tuning the build (see web docs)

* Register shuffling added to compiler which mostly eliminates constant and
  temporary register limits

* Reduce code footprint, make built-in data 'const' so that it compiles
  into the 'text' section

* Augment errors created when a built-in error constructor is called as
  a normal function (e.g. "var e = Error('test')")

* Enforce string/buffer length limits to avoid corner cases with strings
  and buffers close to size_t limit

* Ecmascript E5.1 test cases and fixes

* Mark-and-sweep stringtable leak fixed, affected mostly builds without
  reference counting

* Run a few mark-and-sweep passes in duk_destroy_heap() to give finalizers
  a chance to run in most (but not all) cases

* Coroutine yield fixes

* Portability and bug fixes

0.9.0 (2014-01-XX)
-------------------

* Added API call to force GC, duk_gc()

* Added extended JSON format variants: JSONX and JSONC; NULL pointer
  values string now coerce to "null" instead of e.g. "(nil)" to match
  JSONX format

* Added input line number to compiler error messages (e.g. SyntaxErrors)

* Renamed __duk__ to Duktape for more consistency with Ecmascript conventions,
  removed somewhat useless Duktape.build, added Duktape.env, renamed
  setFinalizer and getFinalizer to setFin and getFin for consistency

* Replace Duktape.addr() and Duktape.refc() with Duktape.info(), which gives
  much more internal detail for a given value

* Removed array size limit for very large array joins

* Improve Unicode handling of Greek final sigma

* Make mark-and-sweep interval relative to current heap size (measured as
  combined object and string count)

* Internal support for periodic bytecode executor interrupts which can
  be used to implement executor step limits, profiling, and debugging

* More feature options for build tuning

* C typing wrapped throughout to allow porting to more exotic platforms,
  e.g. platforms where "int" is a 16-bit type
  **FIXME**

* More self tests to detect obscure compiler bugs, two's complement
  arithmetic, etc (disabled by default)

* Fixed several compile warnings, fixed warnings generated by GCC -Wextra

* Fixed some incorrect assertions (with no underlying bug)

* Fixed a coroutine termination bug which caused assertion errors and
  occasional segfaults when an uncaught error terminated a thread with
  a catch point active

* Fixed a tailcall bug: the current activation was not closed which
  caused variable lookups to fail if an inner function accessed
  variables in the surrounding activation

* Fixed a few bound constructor bugs

* Fixed handling of "get" and "set": they were handled as reserved words
  which prevented valid statements like "var set = 1;"

* Fixed a switch-case bug where code was accepted before the first
  case/default clause

* Fixed a switch-case bug where successive case clauses with no code
  in-between was not handled correctly

* Fixed a for statement control flow bug when the third clause of the for
  statement was empty and a continue was used

* Fixed error lineNumber bug triggered when there was more than 127
  source lines between successive compiled statements

* Fixed some line terminator handling issues

* Fixed relational operator ToPrimitive() coercion order, for some
  operators coercion order was reversed

* Fixed 'with' statement in strict mode (did not throw SyntaxError)

* Fixed strictness handling of an indirect eval call from a strict
  function (eval incorrectly inherited strict mode)

* Several test262 and underscore.js test case fixes (other than above)

* Windows compatibility for both WIN32 and WIN64, tested with MinGW (x86),
  MINGW-w64 (x64), VS2010 Express (x32), VS2013 Express (x32 and x64)

* Portability fixes for non-C99 platforms (like MSVC in VS2010)

* Drop 'full distributable' build, which is replaced by the public GitHub
  repo; simplify Makefiles etc accordingly (this change is not visible in the
  source distributable)
