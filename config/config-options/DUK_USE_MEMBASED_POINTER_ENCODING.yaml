description: >
  All pointers that need to be encoded as string will be encoded in
  lowercase hexadecimal encoding in the byte order they are laid out in
  memory. Decoding will also work the same way. Using this will also
  skip reliance on sscanf for platforms that don't support it.

  When turned off, pointer encoding to string is done via the %p format
  specifier in the printf and scanf family of functions.
