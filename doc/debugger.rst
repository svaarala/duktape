Duktape debugger
================

Introduction
============

Overview
--------

Duktape provides the following basic debugging features:

* Execution status: running/paused at file/line, callstack, local variables

* Execution control: pause, resume, step over, step into, step out

* Breakpoints: file/line pair targeted breakpoint list, "debugger" statement

* Eval in the context of any activation on the callstack when paused (can be
  used to implement basic watch expressions)

* Inspecting heap objects by enumerating internal metadata, properties, and
  walking prototype chains

* Get/put variable at any callstack level

* A mechanism for application-defined requests (AppRequest) and notifications
  (AppNotify)

* Forwarding of logger writes

* Full heap dump (debugger web UI converts to JSON)

Duktape debugging architecture is based on the following major pieces:

* A standard **debug protocol**, implemented directly by Duktape.

* A reliable **debug transport** stream, implemented by the application.

* A **debug API** to attach/detach a debugger to a Duktape heap.

* A **debug client**, running off target, which implements the other
  debug protocol endpoint and provides a user interface.

* An optional **JSON debug protocol proxy** which provides an easier
  JSON-based interface for talking to the debug target.  Example proxy
  implementations written in Node.js and DukLuv are included with Duktape.

This document describes these pieces in detail.

Getting started: debugging with "duk"
-------------------------------------

See ``debugger/README.rst`` for concrete instructions on how to use
``duk --debugger`` as a debug target and ``debugger/duk_debug.js`` as a
debug client.

Getting started: debugging your target
--------------------------------------

To integrate debugger support into your target, you need to:

* **Check your config options**: enable ``DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_SUPPORT`` and
  ``DUK_USE_INTERRUPT_COUNTER`` to enable debugger support in Duktape.
  Also consider other debugging related config options.

* **Implement a concrete stream transport mechanism**: needed for both the
  target device and the Duktape debugger.  The best transport depends on the
  target, e.g. a TCP socket, a serial link, or embedding debug data in an
  existing custom protocol.  An example TCP debug transport is given in
  ``examples/debug-trans-socket/duk_trans_socket_unix.c``.

* **Add code to attach a debugger**: call ``duk_debugger_attach()`` when it
  is time to start debugging.  Duktape will pause execution and process debug
  messages (blocking if necessary).  Execution resumes under control of the
  debug client.

* **When done, detach the debugger**: call ``duk_debugger_detach()`` to stop
  debugging; any debug stream error also causes an automatic detach.  When
  a detach occurs, Duktape resumes normal execution and ignores breakpoints
  etc.  (A detach can also occur if explicitly requested by the debug client
  or if Duktape detects a debug stream error.)

* **If you have an event loop**: optionally call ``duk_debugger_cooperate()``
  once in a while when no call to Duktape is in progress.  This allows debug
  commands to be executed outside of any Duktape calls.

Duktape comes with a bundled debug client which supports a plain TCP transport.
There are also several third party debug clients which may be adapted to talk
to your target: they share the same debug protocol so only the transport will
need adaptation.

You can also write your own debug client by implementing the client side of
the debug protocol.  The debug client is intended to adapt to the target
debug protocol version, so your debug client may need changes from time to
time as the Duktape debug protocol evolves.  The debug protocol is versioned
with the same semantic versioning principles as the Duktape API.

You can implement the binary debug protocol directly in your debug client,
but an easier option is to use the JSON mapping of the debug protocol which
is much more user friendly.  Duktape includes a proxy server which converts
between the JSON mapping and the binary debug protocol which actually runs
on the target.

Example debug client and server
-------------------------------

The Duktape repo contains an example debugger web UI which uses TCP for the
debug transport and can communicate with the Duktape command line tool
("duk").  This running example serves to further document the concrete
details of debug commands and how to implement a debug transport.  The web
console can also directly talk to any other debug targets that use a TCP
debug transport.

The example debugger stuff includes:

* Duktape command line tool ``--debugger`` option which is enabled by using
  both ``DUK_CMDLINE_DEBUGGER_SUPPORT`` and ``DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_SUPPORT``.
  The command line tool uses a TCP socket based example transport provided
  in ``examples/debug-trans-socket/``.

* NodeJS + ExpressJS based minimal debugger Web UI in ``debugger/``
  directory, which uses a TCP socket for debug transport.

**While TCP is a good example transport, it is not a "standard" transport:
the transport is always ultimately up to the user code.**

Example local debugger
----------------------

While a remote debug client is usually preferable, in some cases it may be
useful to terminate the debug connection in the same process as where Duktape
is running.  From Duktape perspective a "local" debugger is just like a remote
one: a debug transport implementation hides the difference from Duktape.
There's an example debug transport with a local dvalue encoder/decoder:

* ``examples/debug-trans-dvalue/``

The example transport hides the details of encoding and decoding dvalues, and
makes it easier to write a local debug client.  The transport also serves as
an example for dealing with dvalues in C (the Node.js debugger has a similar
example for Javascript).

What Duktape doesn't provide
----------------------------

A standard debug transport
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This is up to user code, because the most appropriate transport varies a great
deal: Wi-Fi, serial port, etc.  However, TCP is probably a good default
transport if there are no specific reasons not to use it.  The bundled
example debugger web UI and JSON debug proxy use TCP as a transport.

A standard debugger UI
::::::::::::::::::::::

User code must implement a concrete debugger interface on top of the debug
commands supported by Duktape.  However, Duktape does contain a fully
functional debugger example.  You can extend it as necessary or write your
own.

Function source code
::::::::::::::::::::

Duktape doesn't currently provide function source code over the debug
protocol.  The debug client is assumed to have access to matching source
code, and have the ability to find a source file matching a certain
filename.  This also means that functions created using ``eval`` cannot
be debugged with source present.

Impact of enabling debugger support
===================================

Performance
-----------

There should be very minimal performance impact, except when a debugger is
attached and a running function has active breakpoints.

When bytecode executor restarts it quickly determines that a debugger is not
attached and breakpoints don't need to be processed.  The bytecode executor
interrupt must be enabled to use a debugger which has some impact on bytecode
execution.

Duktape enters "checked execution" when a debugger is attached and the current
function has active breakpoints.  Checked execution (see below for discussion)
is much slower than normal execution; the interrupt handler is executed after
every bytecode instruction.

Code footprint
--------------

Debugger support increases footprint by around 15-20 kB, depending on
debugger features enabled.

Memory footprint
----------------

``duk_heap`` structure size increases because of heap-level debugger state.
If you're using finely tuned memory pools, memory pool sizes may need to
be retuned.

Function instances will always keep their internal ``_Varmap`` property so
that local variables can always be looked up by name.  Without debugger
support the ``_Varmap`` is only kept when it might be needed during
execution (e.g. the function contains an eval call).

Otherwise memory footprint should be negligible.  Duktape doesn't need to
maintain any debug message buffering because all debug data is streamed in
and out.

Security
--------

The debug commands available via the debugger protocol can be (mis)used to
trigger potentially exploitable memory unsafe behavior.  For example, the
debug client may read/write from/to fabricated pointers which has a wide
potential for exploits.

When this is a relevant security concern, the debug transport should provide
authentication, encryption, and integrity protection.  For example, a mutually
certificate authenticated TLS connection can be used.  Duktape itself doesn't
provide any security measures beyond what is provided by the transport.

Debug API
=========

duk_debugger_attach()
---------------------

Called when the application wants to attach a debugger to the Duktape heap::

    duk_debugger_attach(ctx,
                        my_trans_read_cb,         /* read callback */
                        my_trans_write_cb,        /* write callback */
                        my_trans_peek_cb,         /* peek callback (optional) */
                        my_trans_read_flush_cb,   /* read flush callback (optional) */
                        my_trans_write_flush_cb,  /* write flush callback (optional) */
                        my_request_cb,            /* app request callback (optional) */
                        my_detached_cb,           /* debugger detached callback */
                        my_udata);                /* debug udata */

When called, Duktape will enter debug mode, pause execution, and wait for
further instructions from the debug client.  If Duktape debugger support is
not enabled, an error is thrown.

The transport callbacks are given as part of the start request.  Duktape
expects a new virtual stream for every debug start/stop cycle, and will
send a protocol version identifier every time ``duk_debugger_attach()``
is called.

The detached callback is called when the debugger becomes detached.  This
can happen due to an explicit request (``duk_debugger_detach()``), a debug
message/transport error, or Duktape heap destruction.

Unless explicitly mentioned in the API documentation, none of the callbacks
are allowed to call into the Duktape API (this is also the reason why they
mostly don't get a ``ctx`` argument); doing so may cause memory unsafe
behavior.  As a concrete example, if a user read callback calls into the
Duktape API during a read operation, the API call may trigger garbage
collection.  Because garbage collection may have arbitrary side effects,
the debugger command in progress (implemented in ``src-input/duk_debugger.c``)
may then break in a very confusing manner.

duk_debugger_detach()
---------------------

Called when the application wants to detach a debugger::

    duk_debugger_detach(ctx);

When the debugger is detached, Duktape resumes normal execution.  Any
remaining debug state (like breakpoints) is ignored.

If Duktape debugger support is not enabled, an error is thrown.

duk_debugger_cooperate()
------------------------

Optional call to process inbound debug commands when no call into Duktape
is active::

    duk_debugger_cooperate(ctx);

Pending debug commands are executed within the context of the ``ctx`` thread.
All debug commands that can be executed without blocking are executed during
the call.  Because the call doesn't block, it is safe to embed in an event
loop.  The call is a no-op when debugging is not supported or active, so it
can be called without a debug state check.

Note that:

* The caller is responsible for **not** calling this API function when any
  call to Duktape is active (for any context).

* The interval between duk_debugger_cooperate() calls affects Duktape's
  reaction time to pending debug commands.

This API call is needed by some applications to allow debug commands such
as Eval to be executed when no call into Duktape is active.  For example::

    for (;;) {
        /* Wait for events or a timeout. */
        wait_for_events_or_timeout();

        /* Process events. */
        if (event1) {
            ...
        }
        /*...*/

        /* Cooperate with Duktape debugger. */
        duk_debugger_cooperate(ctx);
    }

Because the API call processes all pending inbound messages (available without
blocking), you can also use it like this::

    for (;;) {
        /* Wait for events or a timeout. */
        wait_for_events_or_timeout();

        /* Process events. */
        if (got_inbound_debugger_data) {
            /* Cooperate with Duktape debugger: process all pending messages
             * until new inbound data arrives.
             */
            duk_debugger_cooperate(ctx);
        }
        /*...*/
    }

duk_debugger_pause()
--------------------

The target may call this at any time to request ECMAScript execution to be
paused, and control to be turned over to an attached debug client::

    duk_debugger_pause(ctx);

The call returns without blocking; the requested pause may not happen
immediately but will take place on the next bytecode opcode dispatch.
See the API documentation for more details.

A common use case for this call is to bind it to a hotkey, which allows the
user to break out of and debug infinite loops.  However, like all Duktape API
calls, the call is not thread safe and must be called from the same thread used
to run the ECMAScript code being debugged.

duk_debugger_notify()
---------------------

Optional call to send application specific notifications through the debug
transport::

    duk_bool_t sent;

    duk_push_string(ctx, "BatteryLevel");
    duk_push_uint(ctx, 130);  /* 130 of 1000 */
    sent = duk_debugger_notify(ctx, 2 /*nvalues*/);
    /* 'sent' indicates whether notify was successfully sent or not */

The call returns 0 and is effectively ignored when debugger support is not
compiled in, or when the debugger is not attached.

See "Custom requests and notifications" below for more details.

Debug transport
===============

Overview
--------

Duktape debugger code sends and receives debug messages over an abstracted
reliable stream transport with semantics similar to a TCP connection or a
serial link.  To maximize portability to different environments, Duktape
expects user code to provide the concrete implementation for this transport
in the form of callbacks given to ``duk_debugger_attach()``.

The logical service provided by the transport is a reliable byte stream
with primitives to:

* Read bytes (partial read OK, block if necessary to read at least 1 byte)

* Write bytes (partial write OK, block if necessary to write at least 1 byte)

* Peek for inbound byte(s) without blocking

* Read flush hint

* Write flush hint

Partial reads and writes are allowed to make it as easy as possible to
implement the transport callbacks.  Duktape will handle any "read fully"
and "write fully" semantics automatically by calling read and write as
many times as necessary.

Peeking allows Duktape to detect incoming debug messages without blocking.
This allows debug messages to be processed even when Duktape is running
normally (not in paused state).

Write flushes allow a transport implementation to reliably coalesce writes.
Read flushes allow a transport implementation to manage a receive window
more efficiently.  The read/write flush callbacks are only needed for some
types of transports.

This section covers the detailed semantics for each callback, and discusses
other transport related common issues like flow control, compression, and
security.

**IMPORTANT: The application should assign no meaning to read/write chunk
boundaries.  There is no guarantee that read, write, peek, or flush calls
have any correspondence to debug message boundaries.**

Read callback semantics
-----------------------

* Read length is guaranteed to be >= 1.

* Buffer pointer is guaranteed to be non-NULL.

* Duktape is requesting that at least one and at most "length" bytes are
  read.  Partial reads are OK but at least one byte must be read.  If user
  code cannot read at least one byte, it MUST block until it can.  If one
  or more bytes are available, user code MUST NOT block.

* Return value in the range [1,length] indicates how many bytes were
  read into the given buffer.

* Return value 0 indicates a stream error (sanity timeout, connection
  close, etc).  Duktape will then mark the stream broken and won't do
  any more operations on it.  Debugger will automatically detach.

Write callback semantics
------------------------

* Write length is guaranteed to be >= 1.

* Buffer pointer is guaranteed to be non-NULL.

* Duktape is requesting that at least one and at most "length" bytes are
  written.  Partial writes are OK but at least one byte must be written.
  If user code cannot write at least one byte, it MUST block until it can.

* Return value in the range [1,length] indicates how many bytes were
  written from the given buffer.

* Return value 0 indicates a stream error (sanity timeout, connection
  close, etc).  Duktape will then mark the stream broken and won't do
  any more operations on it.  Debugger will automatically detach.

Peek callback semantics
-----------------------

* Implementing a peek callback is optional (NULL can be passed in
  ``duk_debugger_attach()``) but strongly recommended.  If the callback
  is not provided, some features like pausing execution "out of the blue"
  (while Duktape is running normally) will not work.

* Peek callback has no arguments.

* Duktape is requesting a peek into the input stream, i.e. to see if
  at least one byte can be read without blocking.

* Return value 0 indicates no bytes can be read without blocking.

* Return value > 0 indicates the number of bytes that can be read without
  blocking.  Right now Duktape only cares if at least one byte is available,
  so returning 0 or 1 is sufficient.

* Duktape will currently assume that if at least one byte is available, a
  whole debug message can be read (blocking and handling partial reads as
  necessary).

Read flush callback semantics
-----------------------------

* Implementing a read flush callback is optional (NULL can be passed in
  ``duk_debugger_attach()``).

* Read flush callback has no arguments.

* Duktape is indicating a "read flush" to user code.  Duktape is guaranteed
  to indicate a "read flush" when it may not be doing any more reads on
  that particular occasion.  (However, Duktape may indicate read flushes
  even when it continues to do reads immediately afterwards.)

* For most transports a read flush is not important.  If the transport
  protocol uses a limited read window and has a protocol to update the
  window status to the remote peer, window control messages can be postponed
  to the next read flush (if there's no other pressing reason to send them,
  e.g. a read buffer empty condition).

Write flush callback semantics
------------------------------

* Implementing a write flush callback is optional (NULL can be passed in
  ``duk_debugger_attach()``).

* Write flush callback has no arguments.

* Duktape is indicating a "write flush" to user code.  Duktape is guaranteed
  to indicate a "write flush" when it may not be doing any more writes on
  that particular occasion.  (However, Duktape may indicate write flushes
  even when it continues to do writes immediately afterwards.)

* This indication is useful if the user transport coalesces writes into
  larger chunks.  The user code can send out chunks when buffered data
  becomes large enough or a write flush is indicated.  User code can rely on
  a write flush happening when it matters.

* User code is also free to ignore this indication if it doesn't apply to
  the underlying transport (e.g. when using TCP, there are already
  mechanisms for automatic coalescing of writes) or if there's some other
  mechanism (e.g. a timer) in place to ensure pending bytes are eventually
  sent out.

Marking a transport broken
--------------------------

Duktape marks a transport broken if:

* User callbacks indicate a stream error

* Duktape encounters a parse error when parsing the debug stream

When the debug transport has been marked broken:

* Debugger is automatically detached so that normal ECMAScript execution
  will resume immediately.  If a detached callback exists, it will be called.

* Duktape won't make any more calls to user callbacks for the stream.

* Duktape internal debug read calls return dummy values (zero when reading a
  byte, zero when reading an integer, empty string when reading a string, etc)
  and writes are silently ignored.  This allows the implementation to read and
  write data without checking for errors after every read/write; an explicit
  check for "broken transport" can be made where it's most convenient.

Peek request notes
------------------

Duktape uses peek requests to detect incoming debug commands and process them.
Peeks are used both during normal execution (when there are no relevant
breakpoints and stepping is not active) and during checked execution (when
there is one or more active breakpoints and/or stepping is active).

The rate of peek requests is automatically rate limited by Duktape using a
Date-based timestamp, so that peeks are performed at most every 200ms.

Write flush notes
-----------------

Duktape uses write flushes to indicate that it may not be sending any more
data on this occasion, and that the application should send out any pending
data it has queued.

Duktape writes outbound debug messages in very small pieces so it might make
sense for the application to maintain a buffer for pending outbound data.
When Duktape performs a write, data can be appended to the buffer.  Data can
be sent out when the buffer is large enough, or when Duktape performs a
write flush.

A write flush is guaranteed to occur when Duktape is finished processing a
set of messages so an application doesn't need to have a separate timer
mechanism or similar to flush pending writes.  A write flush is **not**
guaranteed after every outbound debug message (although the current Duktape
implementation behaves that way).

**The user code should make no assumptions about when Duktape indicates a
write flush, other than to send out pending bytes when it happens.**

Reliability
-----------

Duktape expects the transport to be reliable, i.e. no bytes are reordered,
lost, or duplicated.  The concrete transport must provide reliability by
application specific means.  For instance, if TCP sockets are used, reliability
is automatically provided by TCP.  For unreliable packet transports, user code
must provide retransmission, duplicate detection, and sequencing.

Flow control
------------

There is no flow control at the abstract transport level, though an application
is free to implement flow control as part of the transport.  For instance, if
TCP sockets are used, there's automatic flow control as part of TCP.

Flow control may be necessary for devices with very low amount of memory so
that excessive buffer reserves can be avoided.

Compression
-----------

For very slow links it may be appropriate for the application specific
transport to use stream compression for the debug traffic.  Compression
can reduce the stream to around 10-30% of its uncompressed size.

Security
--------

In some environments the debug transport may be security critical.  In such
cases the application should use authentication and encryption for the debug
transport, e.g. use SSL/TLS for the transport.

Implementing on top of a packet-based transport
-----------------------------------------------

This topic is covered in a separate section.

Development time transport torture option
-----------------------------------------

The config option DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_TRANSPORT_TORTURE causes Duktape to do
all debug transport read/write operations in 1-byte steps, which is useful
to catch any incorrect assumptions about reading or writing chunks of a
certain size.

Debug stream format
===================

Overview
--------

The debug protocol is a conversation between Duktape internals and the debug
client.  User code is not aware of the contents of the debug protocol, it
only provides a debug transport to carry chunks of the stream between the
debug target and the debug client.

The debug protocol has a simple three-part life cycle:

* Stream connected, waiting for version identification (sent by Duktape).

* Stream connected, in active use.  Debug messages are exchanged freely in
  each direction.

* Stream disconnected.  This happens on an explicit detach request (i.e. a
  call to ``duk_debugger_detach()``, a read/write error indicated by the
  user's transport callbacks, a message syntax error detected by Duktape,
  or Duktape heap destruction.

The protocol uses request pipelining, i.e. each peer is allowed to send
multiple requests without waiting for replies to previous requests.  To
facilitate this, every request has a corresponding reply/error message and
requests are always processed without reordering.  Neither peer is required
to send pipelined request, and it's perfectly fine for e.g. a debug client
to wait for a response before sending another request.

Version identification
----------------------

When the debug transport is attached, Duktape writes a version identification
as an UTF-8 encoded line of the form::

    <protocolversion> <SP (0x20)> <additional text, no LF> <LF (0x0a)>

The current protocol version is "2" and the identification line currently
has the form::

    2 <DUK_VERSION> <DUK_GIT_DESCRIBE> <target string> <LF>

Everything that follows the protocol version number is informative only.
Example::

    2 20000 v2.0.0 duk command built from Duktape repo

The debug protocol version is available as a define to the user code
(defined by ``duktape.h``)::

    DUK_DEBUG_PROTOCOL_VERSION

This may be useful e.g. when a target can advertise its debug capabilities.

The debug client should parse the line and check the protocol version first.
If the protocol version is not supported, the debug connection should be
closed.  The debug client always adapts to the protocol version present on
the target.  There is no acknowledgement to the version identification, and
there is no corresponding handshake message from the debug client.

When the version identification (handshake) is complete the debug stream
switches to a different framing described below.  The framing is potentially
protocol version specific, which is why the version identification must be
processed first.

Some rationale for the version identification format:

* A one-line text string is a common handshake approach, and has the benefit
  that you can telnet into a target (if it uses a TCP transport) and easily
  see that you've connected to a debugger port.  It can also be easily
  extended to e.g. allow Duktape to advertise optional capabilities (if that
  becomes necessary).

* The version identification allows protocol framing to be changed in the
  future without changing the handshake format.  If version identification
  used the more complex framing described below, it would make version
  compatibility much harder.

* Duktape just sends out the version identification blindly and doesn't need
  to parse a reply, so there's very little cost to having a human readable
  version identification line as compared to e.g. sending a single version
  byte.

* Adding a version identification for the debug client would mean unnecessary
  parsing state for Duktape.  There's little benefit in making Duktape aware
  of the debug client version.

Dvalue
------

After the version identification handshake, the debug stream consists of typed
values called *dvalues* sent in each direction.  Dvalues represent message
framing markers, integers, strings, tagged ECMAScript values, etc.  They can
be parsed without context which is useful for dumping and also allows dvalues
(and debug messages) to be skipped without context.  Debug *messages* are then
constructed as a sequence of dvalues: a start marker, zero or more dvalues,
and an end-of-message marker.

The following table summarizes the dvalues and their formats.  The initial
byte (IB) is used as both a type tag and containing parts of the value in
some cases:

+-----------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------+
| Byte sequence         | Type      | Description                           |
+=======================+===========+=======================================+
| 0x00                  | EOM       | End of message                        |

+-----------------------+-----------+---------------------------------------+

All "integer" representations are semantically the same, i.e. they can all
be used wherever an integer is expected.  Same applies to "string" and
"buffer" representations.

The dvalue typing is sufficient to represent ``duk_tval`` values so that
typing can be preserved (e.g. strings and buffers have separate types).

The dvalues are represented as follows in text below (not needed for all
types in the text)::

    EOM
    REQ
    REP
    ERR
    NFY
    <int: field name>      e.g. <int: error code>
    <str: field name>      e.g. <str: error message>
    <buf: field name>      e.g. <buf: buffer data>
    <ptr: field name>      e.g. <ptr: prototype pointer>
    <tval: field name>     e.g. <tval: eval result>
    <obj: field name>      e.g. <obj: target>
    <heapptr: field name>  e.g. <heapptr: target>

These additional notations are used::

    # Alternatives, e.g. one integer or two strings:
    (<int: foo> | <str: bar> <str: quux>)

    # Repetition, e.g. 0-N integers:
    [<int: foo>]*

    # Repetition, e.g. 1-N values, each string or integer:
    [<str: foo> | <int: bar>]+

When a field does not relate to an ECMAScript value exactly, e.g. the field
is a debugger control field, typing can be loose.  For example, a boolean
field can be represented sometimes as integer dvalue and an arbitrary binary
string as a string dvalue.  The specific types used for each command are
described in per-command sections below.

The intent behind the dvalue format is to:

* Make the lowest level protocol typed so that dvalues and messages can be
  dumped without knowing the particular message being parsed.

* Provide a way to skip a message without understanding its contents, or
  ignore trailing fields in a message, by scanning for the EOM marker.
  This is useful for handling unsupported requests and for extending
  messages by appending dvalues to existing ones.  However, note that reliable
  skipping is only possible if an implementation can parse all dvalue types
  so that it knows their length.  In particular, zero bytes (which are used
  for EOM) can appear inside dvalues too, so skipping to zero byte is not a
  reliable way to skip.

* Provide a framing for requests and responses, which is needed to ensure
  both peers can distinguish replies to its own requests from requests or
  notifications initiated by the other party.

* Allow streamed writing of debug messages without knowing the length of the
  final message in advance (which would be necessary if the framing had a leading
  message length field, for instance).  This is useful to avoid the need to
  precompute message sizes or to use an accumulation buffer to create a full
  message before sending it out.

* Represent all ``duk_tval`` values without loss of information.

* Use short encoding forms for typical numbers and strings to minimize traffic
  for low bandwidth debug transport (like serial lines):

  - The integer range [0,63] encodes to a single byte and is useful for e.g.
    command numbers, status codes, booleans, etc.

  - The integer range [0,16383] encodes to two bytes and is useful for e.g.
    line numbers, typical array indices, loop counter values, etc.

  - Short strings with length [0,31] are encoded to a single byte plus the
    string data.  This is useful for typical filenames, property and variable
    names, etc.

Notes:

* When not sending a ``duk_tval`` value, integer number values must always be
  encoded as plain integers (not the IEEE double encoding).

* When parsing a ``duk_tval`` value, both plain integers and IEEE double
  values must be accepted.  The plain integers map uniquely to IEEE doubles
  so there's no loss of information.  Note that a negative zero must be
  represented as an IEEE double to preserve the sign.

* Fast integers (fastint) are not distinguish from ordinary numbers in the
  debugger protocol.

* Plain buffer values are represented explicitly, but buffer objects
  (Node.js Buffer, ArrayBuffer, DataView, and TypedArray views) are
  represented as objects.  This means that their contents are not
  transmitted, only their heap pointer and a class number.

* The "unused" value is special: it's used internally by Duktape to mark
  unmapped array entries, but is not intended to be used for actual values
  (entries on the value stack, property values, etc).  The "unused" value
  is used in the debugger protocol to denote a missing/none value in some
  command replies.  It's not used in requests, so the debug client should
  never send an "unused" dvalue in a request (e.g. PutVar); Duktape will
  reject such a request as having a format error.

Endianness
----------

As a general rule all values are serialized into network order (big endian).
This applies to pointer values and IEEE doubles.

When pointers or IEEE doubles are part of buffer data they are encoded in
whatever order they exist in memory.  This means that e.g. bytecode dumped
by DumpHeap will be represented as a buffer value with platform specific
byte ordering.  Changing the byte order would be quite awkward because the
debugger code would need to be aware of the memory layout of specific buffer
values.

Representing duk_tval values
----------------------------

The following dvalue types are used for ``duk_tval`` values:

* unused (undefined/unused/none): specific dvalue

* undefined: specific dvalue

* null: specific dvalue

* boolean: specific dvalues for ``true`` and ``false``

* number: signed 32-bit integers can be represented with the simple integer
  dvalues (except negative zero), other numbers are represented as literal
  IEEE doubles

* string: specific dvalues for a few string lengths

* buffer: specific dvalues for a few buffer lengths

* object: represented as a pointer (dangerous when sent from debug client
  to debug target)

* pointer: represented as a pointer

* lightfunc: represented as a point and a flags field (dangerous when sent
  from debug client to debug target)

The notation ``<tval: field name>`` allows any dvalue compatible with a
``duk_tval``.  However, note that some values are dangerous when sent from
the debug client to the target; e.g. it's possible to send a lightfunc value
as an argument to PutVar, for instance, but it's easy to segfault unless
you're very careful.

Request, replies, and notifications
-----------------------------------

A request has the format::

  REQ <int: command> <0-N dvalues> EOM

A success response has the format::

  REP <0-N dvalues> EOM

An error response has the **fixed format** independent of command::

  ERR <int: error code> <str: error message or empty string> EOM

A notification has the format::

  NFY <int: command> <0-N dvalues> EOM

Notes:

* Request and replies don't have a message ID: it is not necessary.  Each peer
  is required to response to incoming requests in order, and every request is
  required to have a single success or error reply, so that replies can be
  reliably associated with previously sent requests.  Note that reply messages
  may still be interleaved with requests and notifications sent by the peer in
  the other direction.

* Only requests/notifications have a command number: the reply messages are
  associated with a request/notification implicitly based on their order in
  the debug stream.

* The error response has a fixed format so that error handling can be uniform.
  There's a specific error code for "unsupported command" so that a debug
  client can easily check if new commands are supported and if not, fall back
  to something else.

* Right now Duktape only sends notifications, never requests, to avoid the
  need to track request/reply state.

Error codes
-----------

+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code   | Description                                                      |
+========+==================================================================+
| 0x00   | Unknown or unspecified error                                     |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x01   | Unsupported command                                              |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x02   | Too many (e.g. too many breakpoints, cannot add new)             |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x03   | Not found (e.g. invalid breakpoint index)                        |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x04   | Application error (e.g. AppRequest-related error)                |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Handling of inbound requests
----------------------------

When either peer decides something unexpected happens, it can simply drop the
transport.  As soon as Duktape detects this, the debugger is automatically
detached and normal execution resumes.  This provides uniform handling for
unexpected errors, and is appropriate behavior e.g. when:

* Invalid or insane dvalue formats are encountered.  There's often no way to
  continue reliably in these cases.

* A parse error when a supported command is being handled.  Such a situation
  would indicate that the peer is buggy or in an inconsistent state.

The exact error handling rules are not specified in great detail here, but
there are a few rules which are important for extensibility:

* If a peer receives a request with an unsupported command number, it MUST
  send back an error reply indicating the command is supported, and MUST NOT
  drop the debug connection.  This behavior is important so that a peer can
  try a command to see if it happens to be supported, and if not, fall back
  to some other behavior.  As a result new commands can be added without
  always strictly bumping the protocol version, and it's possible to add
  optional or custom, target specific commands and "probe" for them.

  - Right now this only applies to Duktape: Duktape never sends requests,
    only notifications.

* If a peer receives a notification with an unsupported command number, it
  MUST ignore the notification, and MUST NOT drop the debug connection.
  The reason is the same as for requests.

* If a supported command is parsed and there are additional dvalues before an
  EOM, the trailing dvalues MUST be ignored.  This allows existing commands
  to be extended (in some cases) without assigning new command numbers or
  bumping the protocol version.

These simple rules are easy to implement and allow the protocol to be extended
gracefully in a few common cases (but certainly not all).

Text representation of dvalues and debug messages
-------------------------------------------------

**This is an informative convention only used in this document and in
duk_debug.js dumps.**

The Duktape debug client uses the following convention for representing
dvalues as text:

* Marker bytes: ``EOM``, ``REQ``, ``REP``, ``ERR``, ``NFY``.

* Integers: string coerced in the obvious way, e.g. ``-123``.

* Strings are mapped 1:1 from a sequence of bytes (0x00...0xff) to a sequence
  codepoints U+0000...U+00FF and then JSON encoded.  JSON encoding ensures
  that the result has no unescaped newlines.  Standard JSON doesn't escape all
  of the codepoints U+0080...U+00FF which unfortunately looks funny (ASCII
  only serialization would be preferable).

* Other types are JSON encoded like in the JSON mapping, see below.

Debug messages are then simply represented as one-liners containing all the
related dvalues (including message type marker and EOM) separate by spaces.
This makes the text dump easy to read, cut-and-paste, diagnose, etc.

As an example, consider a reply whose payload consists of the string "touché",
the integer 123, and the integer -321.  The string would be represented by
Duktape internally as the UTF-8 sequence::

    74 6f 75 63 68 c3 a9

The raw bytes of the reply message could be (with dvalues delimited by pipes)::

    02 | 67 74 6f 75 63 68 c3 a9 | c0 7b | 10 ff ff fe bf | 00

This would then be rendered as a text one-liner::

    REP "touch\u00c3\u00a9" 123 -321 EOM

The odd string mapping is chosen to preserve the exact bytes used by the
string inside Duktape.  Note that some Duktape strings are intentionally
invalid UTF-8 so mapping to Unicode is not always an option.  This string
mapping is also used to represent buffer data.

JSON mapping for debug protocol
===============================

The mapping described in this section is used to map debug dvalues and
messages into JSON values.  The mapping is used to implement a JSON
debug proxy which allows a debug client to interact with a debug target
using clean JSON messages alone without implementing the binary protocol
at all.

JSON representation of dvalues
------------------------------

* Unused::

      { "type": "unused" }

* Undefined::

      { "type": "undefined" }

* Null, true, and false map directly to JSON::

      null
      true
      false

* Integers map directly to JSON number type::

      1234

* Any numbers that can't be represented without loss as JSON numbers
  (e.g. infinity, NaN, negative zero) are expressed as::

      // data contains IEEE double in big endian hex encoded bytes
      // (here Math.PI)
      { "type": "number", "data": "400921fb54442d18" }

  The object may also contain an optional ``value`` field which provides the
  number as a JSON compatible approximate value.  Some accuracy may be lost
  compared to the raw IEEE double, e.g. fraction digits or zero sign may be
  lost.  The value may also be ``null`` for NaN/infinity so that writing code
  can simply rely on ``JSON.stringify()`` to encode the value.  Example::

      // 4.5
      { "type": "number", "data": "4012000000000000", "value": 4.5 }

      // +Infinity
      { "type": "number", "data": "7ff0000000000000", "value": null }

  **IMPORTANT**: the ``value`` key must not be machine processed and is only
  present to make it easier to read JSON protocol text directly.  Parsing code
  must always ignore it and use ``data`` instead.

* Strings are mapped like in the text representation, i.e. bytes 0x00...0xff
  map to Unicode codepoints U+0000...U+00FF::

      // the 4-byte string 0xde 0xad 0xbe 0xef
      "\u00de\00ad\00be\00ef"

  This representation is used because it is byte exact, represents non-UTF-8
  strings correctly, but is still human readable for most practical (ASCII)
  strings.

* Buffer data is represented in hex encoded form wrapped in an object::

      { "type": "buffer", "data": "deadbeef" }

* The message framing dvalues (EOM, REQ, REP, NFY, ERR) are not visible in
  the JSON protocol.  They are used by ``duk_debug.js`` internally with the
  format::

      { "type": "eom" }
      { "type": "req" }
      { "type": "rep" }
      { "type": "err" }
      { "type": "nfy" }

* Object::

      // class is a number, pointer is hex-encoded
      { "type": "object", "class": 10, "pointer": "deadbeef" }

* Pointer::

      // pointer is hex-encoded
      { "type": "pointer", "pointer": "deadbeef" }

* Lightfunc::

      // flags is a 16-bit integer represented as a JSON number,
      // pointer is hex-encoded
      { "type": "lightfunc", "flags": 1234, "pointer": "deadbeef" }

* Heap pointer::

      // pointer is hex-encoded
      { "type": "heapptr", "pointer": "deadbeef" }

JSON representation of debug messages
-------------------------------------

Messages are represented as JSON objects, with the message type marker and the
EOM marker removed, as follows.

Request messages specify the command using a 'request' key and an 'args' array
containing a list of dvalues (EOM omitted)::

    {
        "request": "AddBreak",
        "args": [ "foo.js", 123 ]
    }

The 'args' argument is optional; if it's missing, it's treated the same as an
empty array::

    {
        "request": "AddBreak"
    }

Usually debug commands are specific as strings, with the proxy automatically
mapping the string into a command number using debugger metadata.  You can
specify the command number explicitly and even specify both::

    // Explicit command number (e.g. metadata doesn't know custom command).
    {
        "request": 24,
        "args": [ "foo.js", 123 ]
    }

    // Equivalent, this is a form used earlier (above form preferred).
    {
        "request": true,
        "command": 24,
        "args": [ "foo.js", 123 ]
    }

    // You can also give command name in 'request' and a fallback numeric
    // command in 'command'.  If the command name cannot be resolved via
    // command metadata, the command number in 'command' will then (and only
    // then) be used.
    {
        "request": "AddBreak",
        "command": 24,
        "args": [ "foo.js", 123 ]
    }

Reply messages don't have a command number, so they have a 'reply' key with
a "true" value to allow the message type to be distinguished.  Arguments are
again in 'args' (EOM omitted)::

    {
        "reply": true,
        "args": [ 3 ]
    }

Error messages are like replies, 'error' key has a "true" value, and 'args'
contain the error arguments (EOM omitted)::

    {
        "error": true,
        "args": [ 2, "no space for breakpoint" ]
    }

Notify messages have the same form as requests, but the 'request' key is
replaced with 'notify'::

    {
        "notify": "Status",
        "args": [ 0, "foo.js", "frob", 123, 808 ]
    }

Alternative forms for specifying the notify command number are also available
for notifies::

    {
        "notify": 1,
        "args": [ 0, "foo.js", "frob", 123, 808 ]
    }

    {
        "notify": true,
        "command": 1,
        "args": [ 0, "foo.js", "frob", 123, 808 ]
    }

    {
        "notify": "Status",
        "command": 1,
        "args": [ 0, "foo.js", "frob", 123, 808 ]
    }

If an argument list is empty, 'args' can be omitted from any message.

The request and notify message contain both a request/notify command name and
a number, and several forms are supported.  The command name/number is resolved
as follows:

* If 'request' / 'notify' provides the command name as a string, look up the
  command from command metadata.  If the command is known, use the command number
  in the command metadata (ignore a possible 'command' key).

* If 'request' / 'notify' provides the command number, use that as is.

* If 'command' provides the command number, use that as is.  The 'request' or
  'notify' may also be present with a ``true`` value, and is ignored.

* If the above steps fail, the request / notify cannot be processed.

Other JSON messages
-------------------

In addition to the core message formats above, there are a few custom messages
for debug protocol version info and transport events.  These are expressed as
"notify" messages with a special command name beginning with an underscore, and
no command number.  These are mostly to improve human readability, and minor
details may change as needed.

When connection to the target is attempted a notify like this can be sent::

    {
        "notify": "_TargetConnecting",
        "args": [ "1.2.3.4", 9091 ]
    }

When connected to the target, version identification is relayed verbatim::

    {
        "notify": "_TargetConnected",
        "args": [ "1 10199 v1.1.0-173-gecd806e-dirty duk command built from Duktape repo" ]
    }

When the target disconnects::

    {
        "notify": "_TargetDisconnected"
    }

When a transport error occurs (not necessarily a terminal error so may appear
multiple times)::

    {
        "notify": "_Error",
        "args": [ "some kind of error" ]
    }

When the JSON proxy connection is just about to be disconnected::

    {
        "notify": "_Disconnecting"
    }

An optional reason argument can be included::

    {
        "notify": "_Disconnecting",
        "args": [ "Target disconnected" ]
    }

JSON protocol line formatting
-----------------------------

JSON messages are sent by encoding them in compact one-liner form and
terminating a message with a newline (single LF character, 0x0a).
(Note that the examples above are formatted in multiline format which
is **not** allowed; this is simply for clarity.)

This convention makes is easy to read and write messages.  Messages can
be easily cut-pasted, and message logs can be grepped effectively.

Extending the protocol and version compatibility
================================================

The version identification line provides a protocol version number which is
used to make incompatible changes to the debug protocol; the debug client is
always assumed to conform to the target's debug protocol version.

It is also possible to extend the protocol without bumping the protocol
version number in the following basic ways:

* Add a new command.  If a command is not supported, the peer will send back
  a specific error indicating an unknown/unsupported command.

* Add trailing field(s) to a request, response, or notification.  Once a peer
  has read and processed the fields it supports, it's required to skip to EOM,
  skipping unknown trailing fields.  Some messages have a variable number of
  fields (e.g. a list of variable name/value pairs), in which case this
  approach may not be possible.

These extensions are made possible by (1) the ability to skip to EOM without
understanding message contents, and (2) the processing requirements for
unknown messages and unknown trailing dvalues.

As a general design rule, Duktape internals should be kept clean of version
specific handling and workarounds.  If a feature cannot be implemented cleanly
in a compatible fashion, the protocol version should be bumped instead of
adding parallel variants of commands or making other awkward compromises.
It's important to keep the debugger code small and clean, so that code
footprint is not compromised on the target.

Commands sent by Duktape
========================

Status notification (0x01)
--------------------------

Format::

    NFY <int: 1> <int: state> <str: filename> <str: funcname> <int: linenumber> <int: pc> EOM

Example::

    NFY 1 0 "foo.js" "frobValues" 101 679 EOM

When nothing is executing (happens e.g. when duk_debug_cooperate() is called
from outside of any Duktape activation) filename and funcname are undefined
(the "undefined" dvalue is used) and pc/line are zero.

State is one of:

* 0x00: running

* 0x01: paused, debug client must resume

When execution state changes (e.g. from paused to running or vice versa)
Duktape always sends a Status notification.

When Duktape is running with the debugger attached, it sends a status
notification from time to time to keep the debug client informed of what
file/line and function is being executed.

The rate of Status updates is automatically rate limited using a Date-based
timestamp, so that Status updates are sent at most every 200ms when Duktape
is running in normal or checked mode.

Reserved (0x02)
---------------

(Removed in Duktape 2.0.0, Print notify in Duktape 1.x.)

Reserved (0x03)
---------------

(Removed in Duktape 2.0.0, Alert notify in Duktape 1.x.)

Log notification (0x04)
-----------------------

(Removed in Duktape 2.0.0, Log notify in Duktape 1.x.)

Throw notification (0x05)
-------------------------

Format::

    NFY <int: 5> <int: fatal> <str: msg> <str: filename> <int: linenumber> EOM

Example::

    NFY 5 1 "ReferenceError: identifier not defined" "pig.js" 812 EOM

Fatal is one of:

* 0x00: caught
* 0x01: fatal (uncaught)

Duktape sends a Throw notification whenever an error is thrown, either by
Duktape due to a runtime error or directly by ECMAScript code.

msg is the string-coerced value being thrown.  Filename and line number are
taken directly from the thrown object if it is an Error instance (after
augmentation), otherwise these values are calculated from the bytecode
executor state.

Detaching notification (0x06)
-----------------------------

Format::

    NFY <int: 6> <int: reason> [<str: msg>] EOM

Example::

    NFY 6 1 "error parsing dvalue" EOM

Reason is one of:

* 0x00: normal detach

* 0x01: detaching due to stream error

Duktape sends a Detaching notification when the debugger is detaching.  If the
target drops the transport without the client seeing this notification, it can
assume the connection was lost and react accordingly (for example by trying to
reestablish the link).

``msg`` is an optional string elaborating on the reason for the detach.  It may
or may not be present depending on the nature of detachment.

AppNotify notification (0x07)
-----------------------------

Format::

    NFY <int: 0x07> [<tval>]* EOM

Example::

    NFY 7 "DebugPrint" "Everything is going according to plan!" EOM

This is a custom notification message whose meaning and semantics depend on the
application.

AppNotify messages are used for direct communication between the debug client
and debug target over the Duktape debug protocol.  Both the meaning of a custom
message and the dvalues it contains are entirely up to the implementation and
depending on the needs of the application, need not be supported at all.

See "Custom requests and notifications" below for more details.

Commands sent by debug client
=============================

BasicInfo request (0x10)
------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x10> EOM
    REP <int: DUK_VERSION> <str: DUK_GIT_DESCRIBE> <str: target info>
        <int: endianness> <int: sizeof(void *)> EOM

Example::

    REQ 16 EOM
    REP 10099 "v1.0.0-254-g2459e88" "Arduino Yun" 2 4 EOM

Endianness:

* 1 = little endian

* 2 = mixed endian (doubles in ARM "mixed" endian, integers little endian)

* 3 = big endian

Endianness affects decoding of a few dvalues.

Target info is a string that can be compiled in, and can e.g. describe the
device type.

Void pointer size indicates pointer size used for pointer-related values.
Note that function pointers may have a different size.

TriggerStatus request (0x11)
----------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x11> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 17 EOM
    REP EOM

Duktape will then re-send a status notify.

Pause request (0x12)
--------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x12> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 18 EOM
    REP EOM

If Duktape is already paused, a no-op.  If Duktape is running, Duktape will
check for incoming debug messages from time to time.  When Duktape notices
the pause request (which can take seconds) it will reply to the request,
pause execution, and send a Status notification indicating it has paused.

Resume request (0x13)
---------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x13> [<int: flags>] EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 19 EOM
    REP EOM

Flags describe what pause triggers are enabled (matches internal
DUK_PAUSE_FLAG_xxx constants):

FIXME: these defines should be exposed in duktape.h; they would be useful at least
for some debug clients (and others might scrape them).

+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Flag  | Description                                                          |
+========+======================================================================+
| 0x0001 | Pause after a single opcode has been executed; ignored in a native   |
|        | function.                                                            |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x0002 | Pause when current line number changes; ignored if current function  |
|        | has no line information (typically a native function).               |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x0004 | Pause when entering an inner function.                               |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x0008 | Pause when exiting current function, and when an error is propagated |
|        | past the current function.                                           |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x0010 | Pause when an uncaught error (see below) is about to be thrown.      |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x0020 | Pause when a caught error (see below) is about to be thrown.         |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In addition to these pause triggers, active breakpoints always trigger a pause.

If flags are not explicitly defined (which is allowed for compatibility), the
implied flags are:

* If DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_PAUSE_UNCAUGHT is defined: pause on uncaught (0x0010),
  pause on breakpoints.

* If DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_PAUSE_UNCAUGHT is not defined: pause on breakpoints only.

If Duktape is already running, the pause triggers are updated as if Duktape was
first paused and then resumed immediately.

If Duktape is paused, it will exit the debug message loop associated with the
paused state (where control is fully in the hands of the debug client), resume
execution, and send a Status notification indicating it is running.

An error about to be thrown is considered "uncaught" if:

* There is an Ecmascript try-catch, try-finally, or try-catch-finally in the
  current callstack, or in any callstack of the active thread resume chain.

* Protected API calls (duk_safe_call(), duk_pcall(), etc) are not considered
  catchers for purposes of the pause trigger.

StepInto request (DEPRECATED) (0x14)
------------------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x14> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 20 EOM
    REP EOM

Resume execution and pause when execution exits the current line, enters
another function, exits the current function, or an error is thrown past
the current function (in which case execution pauses in the error catcher,
if any).  If the current function doesn't have line information (e.g. it is
native), pauses on function entry/exit or error throw.

DEPRECATED: equivalent to Resume with the following flags:

* Pause on line change

* Pause on function entry

* Pause on function exit

* Pause on uncaught error, if DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_PAUSE_UNCAUGHT config option
  is defined.

StepOver request (DEPRECATED) (0x15)
------------------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x15> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 21 EOM
    REP EOM

Resume execution and pause when execution exits the current line, exits the
current function, or an error is thrown past the current function (in which
case execution pauses in the error catcher, if any).  If the current function
doesn't have line information (e.g. it is native), pauses on function exit or
error throw.

DEPRECATED: equivalent to Resume with the following flags:

* Pause on line change

* Pause on function exit

* Pause on uncaught error, if DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_PAUSE_UNCAUGHT config option
  is defined.

StepOut request (DEPRECATED) (0x16)
-----------------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x16> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 22 EOM
    REP EOM

Resume execution and pause when execution exits the current function or an
error is thrown past the current function (in which case execution pauses
in the error catcher, if any).

DEPRECATED: equivalent to Resume with the following flags:

* Pause on function exit

* Pause on uncaught error, if DUK_USE_DEBUGGER_PAUSE_UNCAUGHT config option
  is defined.

ListBreak request (0x17)
------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x17> EOM
    REP [ <str: fileName> <int: line> ]* EOM

Example (two breakpoints)::

    REQ 23 EOM
    REP "foo.js" 102 "bar.js" 99 EOM

AddBreak request (0x18)
-----------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x18> <str: fileName> <int: line> EOM
    REP <int: breakpoint index> EOM

Example::

    REQ 24 "foo.js" 109 EOM
    REP 3 EOM

If there's no space for more breakpoints, a "too many" error is sent::

    REQ 24 "foo.js" 109 EOM
    ERR 2 "no space for breakpoint" EOM

DelBreak request (0x19)
-----------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x19> <int: index> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 25 3 EOM
    REP EOM

If an invalid index is used, an error reply is sent.

GetVar request (0x1a)
---------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x1a> <int: level> <str: varname> EOM
    REP <int: 0/1, found> <tval: value> EOM

Example::

    REQ 26 -1 "testVar" EOM
    REP 1 "myValue" EOM

Level specifies the callstack depth, where -1 is the topmost (current) function,
-2 is the calling function, etc.  If not provided, the topmost function will be
used.

PutVar request (0x1b)
---------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x1b> <int: level> <str: varname> <tval: value> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 27 -1 "testVar" "newValue" EOM
    REP EOM

Level specifies the callstack depth, where -1 is the topmost (current) function,
-2 is the calling function, etc.  If not provided, the topmost function will be
used.

GetCallStack request (0x1c)
---------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x1c> EOM
    REP [ <str: fileName> <str: funcName> <int: lineNumber> <int: pc> ]* EOM

Example::

    REQ 28 EOM
    REP "foo.js" "doStuff" 100 317 "bar.js" "doOtherStuff" 210 880 EOM

List callstack entries from top to bottom.

GetLocals request (0x1d)
------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x1d> <int: level> EOM
    REP [ <str: varName> <tval: varValue> ]* EOM

Example::

    REQ 29 -1 EOM
    REP "x" "1" "y" "3.1415" "foo" "bar" EOM

List local variable names from specified activation (the internal ``_Varmap``).
Level specifies the callstack depth, where -1 is the topmost (current) function,
-2 is the calling function, etc.

The result includes only local variables declared with ``var`` and locally
declared functions.  Variables outside the current function scope, including
outer functions and global variables, are not included.

.. note:: The local variable list doesn't currently include dynamically
   declared variables introduced by e.g. eval(), or variables with a
   dynamic scope like the catch variable in try-catch.  This will be fixed
   in future versions.

Eval request (0x1e)
-------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x1e> (<int: level> | <null>) <str: expression> EOM
    REP <int: 0=success, 1=error> <tval: value> EOM

Example::

    REQ 30 null "1+2" EOM
    REP 0 3 EOM

Level specifies the callstack depth, where -1 is the topmost (current) function,
-2 is the calling function, etc.  If not provided, the topmost function will be
used (as with a real ``eval()``).  The level affects only the lexical scope of
the code evaluated.  The callstack will be intact, and will be visible in e.g.
stack traces and ``Duktape.act()``.  The level can also be null to perform an
indirect Eval.

If a valid callstack level is given, the eval expression is evaluated as if a
"direct call" to eval was executed in the position where execution has paused,
in the lexical scope specified by the provided callstack level.  A direct eval
call shares the same lexical scope as the function it is called from (an
indirect eval call does not).  For instance, suppose we're executing::

    function foo(x, y) {
        print(x);  // (A)
        print(y);  // (B) <== paused here (before print(y))
    }

    foo(100, 200);

and you'd eval::

    print(x + y); y = 10; "quux"

The Eval would execute as if the code had been::

    function foo(x, y) {
        print(x);
        eval('print(x + y); y = 10; "quux");
        print(y);
    }

    foo(100, 200);

so that the Eval statement would:

* Print out 300 (using print).

* Assign 10 to ``y`` so that statement B would then print 10 (instead of 200).

* The final result of the eval would be the string ``"quux"``, which would then
  be shown in the debug client UI.

When Eval is requested from outside any Duktape activation, e.g. while doing
a duk_debugger_cooperate() call, there is no active ECMAScript activation so
that a "direct" Eval is not possible.  Eval will then be executed as an
indirect Eval instead.  As noted above, you can request an indirect Eval
explicitly by sending null for the callstack level.

Current limitations:

* Can get stuck in an infinite loop.

* The debug code runs inside an actual ``eval()`` call which affects the call
  stack.  For example, ``Duktape.act()`` will see the additional stack frames.

Detach request (0x1f)
---------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x1f> EOM
    REP EOM

Example::

    REQ 31 EOM
    REP EOM

Request that Duktape detach the debugger.  Duktape requests the user transport
code to close the transport connection, and then resumes normal execution.

DumpHeap request (0x20)
-----------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x20> EOM
    REP <dvalues> EOM

Example::

    REQ 32 EOM
    REP <dvalues> EOM

Dump contents of the entire Duktape heap.  The format of the heap dump is
somewhat complicated; see ``duk_debugger.c`` for the format.

This is used to implement a debugger UI feature where you can download a JSON
dump of the heap state for analysis.

.. note:: This command is somewhat incomplete at the moment.  It will be useful
   to implement a heap browser, and will probably be completed together with
   some kind of UI.

.. note:: The dump format may potentially change to leverage GetHeapObjInfo
   to read details of individual heap objects.  This command would then simply
   provide a list of objects the debug client can inspect on its own.

GetBytecode request (0x21)
--------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x21> (<int: level> | <obj: target> | <heapptr: target>) EOM
    REP <int: numconsts> (<tval: const>){numconsts}
        <int: numfuncs> (<tval: func>){numfuncs}
        <str: bytecode> EOM

Example without argument, gets bytecode for current function::

    REQ 33 EOM
    REP 2 "foo" "bar" 0  "...bytecode..." EOM

Callstack level can be given explicitly, for example -3 is the third callstack
level counting from callstack top::

    REQ 33 -3 EOM
    REP 2 "foo" "bar" 0  "...bytecode..." EOM

An explicit ECMAScript function object can also be given using an "object" or
"heapptr" dvalue::

    REQ 33 {"type":"object","class":6,"pointer":"00000000014839e0"} EOM
    REP 2 "foo" "bar" 0  "...bytecode..." EOM

An error reply is returned if:

* The argument exists but has an invalid type or points to a target value
  which is not an ECMAScript function.

* Callstack entry doesn't exist or isn't an ECMAScript activation.

Notes:

* Bytecode endianness is target specific so the debug client needs to get
  target endianness and interpret the bytecode based on that.

* Minor change from Duktape 1.4.0: when the callstack entry doesn't exist
  Duktape 1.5.x and above will return an error rather than an empty result.

.. note:: This command is somewhat incomplete at the moment and may be modified
   once the best way to do this in the debugger UI has been figured out.

.. note:: This command may be removed in favor of using GetHeapObjInfo to
   get the same bytecode information.

AppRequest request (0x22)
-------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x22> [<tval>*] EOM
    REP [<tval>*] EOM

Example::

    REQ 34 "GameInfo" "GetTitle" EOM
    REP "Spectacles: Bruce's Story" EOM

If the target hasn't registered a request callback, Duktape responds::

    ERR 2 "AppRequest unsupported by target" EOM

The application request callback may also indicate an error, e.g.::

    ERR 4 "missing argument for SetFrameRate"

This is a custom request message whose meaning and semantics depend on the
application.

AppRequest messages are used for direct communication between the debug client
and debug target over the Duktape debug protocol.  Both the meaning of a custom
message and the dvalues it contains are entirely up to the implementation and
depending on the needs of the application, need not be supported at all.

See "Custom requests and notifications" below for more details.

GetHeapObjInfo (0x23)
---------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x23> (<heapptr: target> | <object: target> | <pointer: target>) EOM
    REP [<int: flags> <str/int: key> [<tval: value> | <obj: getter> <obj: setter>]]* EOM

Example::

    REQ 35 { "type": "heapptr", "pointer": "deadbeef" } EOM
    REP 0 "class_name" "ArrayBuffer" ... EOM

Inspect a heap object using the provided heap pointer; any dvalue type
containing a pointer is allowed: heapptr, object, pointer.  The debug client
is responsible for ensuring that the pointer is safe, i.e. that the pointer
is valid and the pointer target is still in the Duktape heap:

* When the debugger is paused garbage collection is automatically disabled so
  that any pointers obtained while the debugger remains paused are safe.  Once
  execution is resumed using Resume or a step command, all pointers are
  potentially invalidated by garbage collection.

* When the debugger is not paused the debug client may safely inspect an
  object if it's known with 100% certainty that the object is reachable and
  therefore safe to inspect.  Because this is generally not a safe assumption,
  you should avoid making it unless it's really necessary.

* **WARNING**: Inspecting an unsafe pointer causes memory unsafe behavior and
  may lead to crashes, etc.

The result is a list of artificial property entries, each containing a flags
field, a key, and a value.  See GetObjPropDesc for the shared format used.

Artificial properties are not actually present in a property table but are
generated based on e.g. ``duk_heaphdr`` flags and are string keyed to make
versioning easier.  Artifical properties expose internal fields which may
change between versions and are not part of version guarantees.  As a result
the artificial property keys and/or values may change between versions.
However, because the properties are string keyed it's relatively easy for the
debug client to adapt to such changes.

The current artificial keys are described in the section "Heap object
inspection".

GetObjPropDesc (0x24)
---------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x24> <obj: target> <str: key> EOM
    REP <int: flags> (<str: key> | <int: key>) (<tval: value> | <obj: getter> <obj: setter>) EOM

Example::

    REQ 36 { "type": "object", "class": 10, "pointer": "deadbeef" } "message" EOM
    REP 7 "message" "Hello there!" EOM

Inspect a property of an ECMAScript object using a specific string key
without causing side effects such as getter calls or Proxy traps.  The
result is either:

* A property value using the format described below.

* A "not found" error if the property doesn't exist.

Properties stored in the internal "array part" are indexed using numeric
string keys, e.g. ``"3"``, not integers.

Proxy objects are inspected as is without invoking any traps.  The only
properties usually available are the Duktape specific internal control
properties indicating the target and the handler object with traps.  A Proxy
object can be reliably detected using the artificial property ``exotic_proxyobj``
returned by GetHeapObjInfo.

See GetHeapObjInfo for notes about pointer safety.

Each property entry is described using the following sequence of dvalues
(this format is shared with other property related commands, including
GetHeapObjInfo and GetObjPropDescRange):

* Flags field

  - A bit mask (described below)

* Key

  - Always a string, for array index properties convert index to canonical
    index string (e.g. ``"3"``)

* Property value:

  - If property is not an accessor (apparent from flags field): single dvalue
    representing a duk_tval

  - If property is an accessor: two dvalues pointing to getter and setter
    functions (respectively)

The flags field is an unsigned integer bitmask with the following bits:

+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Bitmask | Description                                                     |
+=========+=================================================================+
| 0x01    | Property attribute: writable, matches                           |
|         | DUK_PROPDESC_FLAG_WRITABLE.                                     |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x02    | Property attribute: enumerable,                                 |
|         | matches DUK_PROPDESC_FLAG_ENUMERABLE.                           |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x04    | Property attribute: configurable, matches                       |
|         | DUK_PROPDESC_FLAG_CONFIGURABLE.                                 |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x08    | Property attribute: accessor, matches                           |
|         | DUK_PROPDESC_FLAG_ACCESSOR.                                     |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x10    | Property is virtual, matches DUK_PROPDESC_FLAG_VIRTUAL.         |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x100   | Property key is a Symbol.                                       |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x200   | Property is a hidden Symbol which is not visible to ordinary    |
|         | ECMAScript code.                                                |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

For artificial properties (returned by GetHeapObjInfo) the property attributes
are not relevant (sent as zero) and the value is currently never an accessor.

GetObjPropDescRange (0x25)
--------------------------

Format::

    REQ <int: 0x25> <obj: target> <int: idx_start> <int: idx_end> EOM
    REP [<int: flags> (<str: key> | <int: key>) (<tval: value> | <obj: getter> <obj: setter>)]* EOM

Example::

    REQ 37 { "type": "object", "class": 10, "pointer": "deadbeef" } 0 2 EOM
    REP 7 "name" "Example object" 7 "message" "Hello there!" EOM

Inspect a range ``[idx_start,idx_end[`` of an ECMAScript object's "own"
properties.  Result contains properties found; if the start/end index is
larger than available property count those values will be missing from the
result entirely.  For example, if the object has 3 properties and the range
``[0,10[`` is requested, the result will contain 3 properties only.  If the
indices are crossed (e.g. ``[10,5[``) an empty result is returned.

The indices in the range ``[idx_start,idx_end[`` refer to a conceptual index
space which is guaranteed to be stable as long as (1) execution is paused
so that garbage collection is prevented, and (2) the object is not mutated.
The property order within the index space has no specific guarantees and
does not necessarily match enumeration order; the debug client should reorder
the properties if a specific presentation order is needed.

The current index space (which may change in future versions) contains:

* The object's internal array part, indices ``[0,a_size[``.  Here ``a_size``
  is the space allocated for the dense array part and may be larger than the
  apparent ``.length`` property of the array.  Unmapped values and missing
  array indices are returned as "unused" dvalues.

* The object's internal entry part, indices ``[0,e_next[``.  The entry part
  may contain deleted properties which are returned as "unused" dvalues.

The debug client doesn't need to care about these details, and can simply read
arbitrary ranges (even those spanning the two parts) provided that it correctly
deals with "unused" values.

The debug client can request all properties simply by requesting the index
range ``[0,0x7fffffff[`` (signed indices for now).  The result will only contain
as many properties as are actually present.

The debug client can also iterate over the property set incrementally as
follows:

* Request index ranges in sequence, for example ``[0,10[``, ``[10,20[``, etc.

* When a partial result (here less than 10 properties) is received, we're done.
  Equivalent approach is to stop iterating when you get an entirely empty result.

The properties included in the index space are the target object's "own"
properties, without side effects:

* Property attributes are provided in a flags field.  Internal properties,
  currently implemented using keys starting with the 0xFF byte, are flagged
  explicitly so that the debug client doesn't need to check the marker byte
  (which may change in future versions) separately.

* Accessor properties are described as is, as a setter/getter pair, without
  invoking the getter.  The debug client can do that explicitly if it so
  desires.

* Inherited properties are not enumerated.  The debug client can walk the
  prototype chain manually by looking up the ``prototype`` artificial
  property and inspecting that object separately.  Prototype walking should
  carefully avoid failing on a prototype loop.

* Some properties which are implemented in a fully virtualized fashion are
  visible in ECMAScript enumeration but may not be visible in the inspection.
  For example, String object has virtual index properties (0, 1, 2, ...) for
  string characters, and these are not included in the inspection result at
  the moment.  They can be read using GetObjPropDesc, however.

* Proxy traps are not invoked, and the properties returned are the "own"
  properties of the Proxy itself.  Typically the Proxy has only Duktape
  specific internal control properties identifying the Proxy target and
  handler table.

Note that Array objects can be dense or sparse.  This distinction is internal:
dense arrays have an array part where the array items are stored while sparse
arrays don't have an array part and array items are stored in the main property
table together with normal string keyed properties.  Array items for sparse
arrays will thus appear as normal string keyed properties, and may not be in
ascending index order; the debug client should always reorder properties to
fit the preferred display order.  Array gaps may be visible either as missing
keys or as keys with the dvalue "unused".  Currently gaps in sparse arrays
will be visible as missing keys while gaps in dense arrays are visible as
"unused" dvalues; the debug client should handle both cases.

See GetHeapObjInfo for notes about pointer safety.

Custom requests and notifications
=================================

Starting in Duktape 1.5.x, Duktape supports direct communication between the
debug client and debug target over the same transport by using the special
AppRequest and AppNotify messages.  These messages have no meaning to Duktape,
which merely serves to marshal them back and forth through a defined API.

AppNotify messages may be sent by pushing the contents of the message to the
stack and calling ``duk_debugger_notify()`` passing the number of values
pushed.  Each value pushed will be sent as a dvalue in the message.  So if you
push two strings, "foo" and "bar", the client will see ``NFY 7 "foo" "bar" EOM``.

AppRequest is used to make requests to the target which are not directly
related to ECMAScript execution and may be implementation-dependent.  For
example, an AppRequest might be used to:

* Download source files directly from the debug target file system

* Change the frame rate of a game engine

* Reset/reboot an embedded target device while debugging

* Perform or trigger software or script updates

A target that wishes to support AppRequest should provide a request callback
when calling ``duk_debugger_attach()``.  When an AppRequest is received, the
request callback is invoked with the contents of the message on the value
stack, and may push its own values to be sent in reply.  The request callback
may block if necessary (for example, the callback might wait for a hardware
button press).  Note, however, that Duktape will also be blocked while the
callback executes which may not be desirable in some cases and may cause a
debug client to time out (this of course depends entirely on the debug client).

This is a minimal do-nothing request callback::

    duk_idx_t duk_cb_debug_request(duk_context *ctx, void *udata, duk_idx_t nvalues) {
        /* Number of return values is returned: here empty reply. */
        return 0;
    }

The above dummy callback simply responds with ``REP EOM`` (an empty reply) to
all requests.

A more useful callback should process the values it receives on the value
stack, push its own values to send in reply, and return a non-negative integer
indicating how many values it pushed.  Here is a slightly more useful
implementation::

    duk_idx_t duk_cb_debug_request(duk_context *ctx, void *udata, duk_idx_t nvalues) {
        const char *cmd_name = NULL;

        /* Callback must be very careful NEVER to access values below
         * 'nvalues' topmost value stack elements.
         */
        if (nvalues >= 1) {
            /* Must access values relative to stack top. */
            cmd_name = duk_get_string(ctx, -nvalues + 0);
        }

        if (cmd_name == NULL) {
            /* Return -1 to send an ERR reply.  The value on top of the stack
             * should be a string which will be used for the error text sent
             * to the debug client.
             */
            duk_push_string(ctx, "missing application specific command name");
            return -1;
        } else if (strcmp(cmd_name, "VersionInfo") == 0) {
            /* Return a positive integer to send a REP containing values pushed
             * to the stack.  The return value indicates how many dvalues you
             * are including in the response.
             */
            duk_push_string(ctx, "My Awesome Program");
            duk_push_int(ctx, 81200);  /* ver. 8.12.0 */
            return 2;  /* 2 dvalues */
        } else {
            duk_push_sprintf(ctx, "unrecognized application specific command name: %s",
                             cmd_name);
            return -1;
        }
    }

If no request callback is provided at attach, AppRequest will be treated as an
unsupported command, eliciting an ERR reply from Duktape saying so.  A target
is always free to send AppNotify messages.

As a precaution, the target should try to avoid sending structured values such
as JS objects in notify messages as their heap pointers may become stale by
the time the client receives and inspects them.  This is especially true for
notifications sent while the target is running.  It's better to stick to
primitives which have unique dvalue representations, e.g. numbers, booleans,
and strings.  If a structured value does need to be sent, it can simply be
e.g. JSON/JX encoded and sent as a string instead (carefully avoiding uncaught
errors).

Important notes on the request callback
---------------------------------------

The request callback is provided with a ``duk_context`` pointer with which it
can access the value stack and is assumed to be trusted.  There are certain
things it MUST NOT do.  Specifically:

* It MUST NOT assume that ``nvalues`` has any specific value.  In particular
  it might be zero so that there are no arguments to the callback (not even a
  string used, by convention, to identify an application specific command).

* It MUST NOT attempt to access or pop any values from the top of the stack
  beyond the ``nvalues`` it is given and the values it pushes itself.

* It MUST NOT assume any specific value for ``duk_get_top()`` and similar
  primitives.  In practice this means using negative stack indices to access
  values.

* It MUST NOT throw errors.  It is very easy to accidentally throw an error
  when working with value stack values directly, so caution must be exercised
  here.

Violating this contract is undefined behavior and may corrupt debugger state,
cause incorrect behavior, or even lead to a segfault.  In the future it would
be nice to make this more robust, e.g. by sandboxing the function so that it
cannot access unrelated stack values and is allowed to throw errors safely.

The dvalues of a message are pushed in the order they are received.  This makes
them inconvenient to access using negative indices, since the relative position
of any given value on the stack is dependent on the total number of values.
However because the callback receives the total number of values as a parameter,
a useful convention is to index the stack like so::

    if (nvalues < 3) {
        duk_push_string(ctx, "not enough arguments");
        return -1;
    }
    cmd_name = duk_get_string(ctx, -nvalues + 0);
    val_1 = duk_get_string(ctx, -nvalues + 1);
    val_2 = duk_get_int(ctx, -nvalues + 2);

AppRequest/AppNotify command format
-----------------------------------

As a general convention, it is recommended for the first field in an AppRequest
or AppNotify message after the command number be a string identifying the
command, e.g. "VersionInfo" or "RebootDevice".  This makes it simpler for
different clients and targets to interoperate.  Unrecognized command names can
simply be ignored, whereas, e.g. integer commands may be interpreted
differently depending on the debug client and target in use.

If a command is specific to your application in some way (purpose or behavior),
it might make sense to add a prefix, e.g. "MyApp-AwesomeCmd".  This avoids
clashes with other targets which may have similarly-named commands.

Ultimately, no convention or overall form for application message contents is
actually enforced by Duktape.  A peer should therefore not make any assumptions
about the contents of an AppRequest or AppNotify message unless it knows
exactly where that message came from.

Heap object inspection
======================

Artificial keys are subject to change between versions.

The following, however, have versioning guarantees:

* ``prototype``: internal prototype (not to be confused with a possible
  "prototype" property, which is the external prototype).

* ``class_name``: string name for object class

* ``class_number``: object class number, matches object dvalue

"debugger" statement
====================

ECMAScript has a debugger statement::

    a = 123;
    debugger;
    a = 234;

The E5 specification states that:

    Evaluating the DebuggerStatement production may allow an implementation
    to cause a breakpoint when run under a debugger.  If a debugger is not
    present or active this statement has no observable effect.

Other ECMAScript engines typically treat a debugger statement as a breakpoint:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger
* http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/0bwt76sk%28v=vs.94%29.aspx
* http://blog.katworksgames.com/2012/09/27/debugger-statement-makes-javascript-development-easier/

Duktape interprets it as a breakpoint too, i.e. execution is paused if a
debugger statement is encountered while a debug client is attached.  This
allows breakpoints to be set even in anonymous eval code (though there
will be no access to source code).

Implementing a debug transport on top of a packet-based transport
=================================================================

Implementing a debug transport over a packet-based lower level protocol is
essentially the same problem as forwarding a TCP stream or a virtual serial
link over the packed-based protocol.  There is very little Duktape specific
in doing so, and the problem is quite well understood.  This section provides
some pointers.

Basic issues
------------

* You'll need a mechanism to reliably send and receive arbitrary chunks of data
  with no reordering or duplication.  This mechanism is needed both for the
  target and the debug client.

* If buffering is an issue you may need to implement a flow control mechanism.
  Usually buffering is only an issue on the debug target, so one way flow
  control is usually enough.

* To ensure data chunks sent by the debug target are reasonably sized, you may
  need to coalesce debug transport writes made by Duktape and use "write flush"
  to flush out pending bytes when no more data will be sent.  Alternatively you
  could use a timer, similarly to what TCP does.

If you also implement your own debug client you need to parse the debug stream
from the data chunks received, e.g. with trial parsing:

* Read an incoming data chunk and append it to an input byte buffer.

* Trial parse for debug messages until no more complete messages can be parsed.
  Then wait for next inbound data chunk.

* **Because the boundaries of debug messages are not guaranteed to align with the
  read/write calls Duktape makes into the transport implementation, you should
  not try to match debug messages to the data chunks sent/received by your
  transport implementation!**

Coalescing writes example
-------------------------

* Maintain a buffer BUF of max N bytes for outbound writes.

* For each Duktape transport write call:

  - If the write data fits into BUF, append it.  If not, append as many bytes
    as fit in the remaining BUF space (partial write).

  - If the buffer is now full (N bytes), send and empty the buffer.

  - Return value to Duktape indicates how many values were consumed, i.e.
    appended to BUF.

* For each Duktape transport write flush:

  - If there are bytes in BUF, send and empty the buffer.

  - Note that you can rely on Duktape performing a write flush before it
    finishes writing and e.g. blocks on read or resumes execution.  Write
    flushes may also happen at other times.  **Don't assign any other
    meaning to the flushes, e.g. a write flush is not guaranteed to match
    debug message boundaries!**

One-way flow control example
----------------------------

A simple one-way flow control mechanism to ensure a debug target can be
implemented with a fixed inbound buffer of MAXBUF bytes (MAXBUF is something
small like 256):

* The debug client maintains two byte counts:

  1. SENT indicates how many bytes have been sent since the start of
     the debug connection.

  2. ACKED indicates how many bytes the debug target has confirmed to have
     consumed.  SENT - ACKED is the number of bytes potentially in the target
     input buffer.

* The debug client then knows that the target can buffer at least
  MAXBUF - (SENT - ACKED) bytes, so that it's free to send that amount.

* When the debug target receives data chunks from the debug client, it:

  - Appends the data chunk to an inbound data buffer.  There should always
    be space for the data if the debug client behaves correctly.

* When Duktape calls the debug transport read callback:

  - Consume bytes from the inbound data buffer.

  - Send a transport specific notification to the debug client, updating
    the ACKED byte count (= number of bytes consumed by Duktape read calls).

Because Duktape performs a lot of small reads, it may be useful to:

* In the debug transport read callback:

  - Don't send a notification for the updated ACKED byte count unless the
    change to a previously sent value is large enough.

* Rely on the debug transport "read flush" indication:

  - When received, always send a notification for the updated ACKED byte
    count.

There are many other options too, for example, send an updated ACKED byte
count when:

* Receiving bytes from the debug target.

* When Duktape reads bytes, only send an updated ACKED byte count when the
  read is made from a completely full input buffer (i.e., the debug client
  is currently not sending any data until we notify it we have space).

Implementation notes
====================

Overview
--------

This section contains some implementation notes on the Duktape internals.

Duktape debugger support is optional and enabled with a config option.
The bytecode executor interrupt feature is also mandatory when debugger
support is enabled.

Source files
------------

The debugger support is implemented almost entirely in the following files:

* ``duk_js_executor.c``: checked execution, breakpoints, step into/over,
  interfacing with debugger message loop

* ``duk_hthread_stacks.c``: step out handling

* ``duk_debugger.c``: debug transport, debug command handling

* ``duk_api_debug.c``: debugger API entrypoints

Attaching and detaching a debugger to a heap
--------------------------------------------

When user code attaches a debugger using ``duk_debugger_attach()``, Duktape
updates the ``duk_heap`` state to reflect that a debugger is attached,
store the callbacks etc.

The debugger operates on a Duktape heap level, as other options seem to lead
to confusing outcomes.  For instance, if a debugger were attached to a single
thread breakpoints would only be triggered by that thread.  Even so, when a
breakpoint was triggered, the whole heap would be paused because there's no
way to pause a single thread and resume execution of others.

Execution modes, executor interrupt, and "restart_execution"
------------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps the most critical capability needed to implement a debugger is to have
an efficient way of detecting active breakpoints, trigger on a breakpoint, and
implement stepped execution.  These are implemented in the Duktape bytecode
executor as follows.

Debugger support relies on the executor interrupt feature, which provides the
ability to interrupt bytecode execution periodically or after every bytecode
instruction.  This mechanism is used to implement three conceptual modes of
execution:

* **Normal**: bytecode executor executes at full speed, calling into the
  executor interrupt once in a while.  When in the interrupt, we peek for
  debug client messages (this allows an out-of-the-blue pause for instance),
  execution timeout etc.

* **Checked**: bytecode executor executes opcodes one at a time, calling into
  the executor interrupt before every instruction.  The interrupt detects line
  transitions, checks if any breakpoints or stepping related conditions are
  triggered, and peeks (but doesn't block waiting) for debug client messages.

* **Paused**: bytecode executor calls into executor interrupt, and the executor
  interrupt processes debug client messages until the debug client issues some
  control flow related command like step over/into/out or resume.  Execution is
  under complete control of the debug client.

The "paused" mode is concretely implemented in the executor interrupt simply
by processing debug messages until some kind of resume/detach command is
encountered.

The "checked" mode is implemented by careful management of the interrupt
counter.  This is important so that no additional checks are introduced into
the executor fast path: only a single interrupt counter check is needed.
When execution is restarted, the need for checked execution is detected
(e.g. there are active breakpoints or stepping is active) and the interrupt
counter is configured to trigger an interrupt before any opcodes are
executed.  If we need to remain in checked mode, the interrupt handler
will again configure the interrupt counter to ensure only one opcode is
executed before again returning to the interrupt handler.

The "normal" execution mode is similar but the interrupt counter is configured
into a higher value (e.g. interrupt every hundred thousand opcodes) when
returning to the bytecode executor.

The ``restart_execution:`` label in the bytecode executor is an important
control point.  It is called whenever the bytecode executor is about to
start executing a new activation, but can also be called explicitly e.g.
when debug commands have adjusted breakpoint state.  The "restart execution"
operation does a lot of important things:

* It checks for debugger attached/detached state.  If detached, all other
  debugger related checks are skipped.

* It checks for active breakpoints in the current function, and writes out
  the active breakpoint list to make breakpoint trigger checks faster in
  the executor interrupt.

* It checks for active stepping state.  Both step into and step over require
  some handling.

* It checks for paused state too.  In some cases a "paused" flag can be set
  outside the bytecode executor.  For example, when doing a "step out", the
  callstack unwinding code sets a "paused" flag when unwinding the activation
  we're stepping out of.  We detect this only when "restart execution" is
  called the next time.

* Ultimately, it decides whether execution should proceed in checked mode or
  normal mode.

After execution proceeds normally, with the help of the executor interrupt
mechanism and the interrupt handler.  The execution mode can only changed by
the interrupt handler (e.g. if it starts setting the interrupt counter to a
higher value) or if "restart_execution" is invoked again.

From the bytecode executor perspective the integration is quite simple:

* "restart_execution" does a lot of debugger processing as part of setting
  up execution.

* The interrupt counter mechanism is used to call into the interrupt handler,
  and the actual opcode executor doesn't have to worry about the rest.

Stepping and pausing
--------------------

The following internal heap level state is needed:

- Pause state: heap wide flag indicating we need to talk with the debug client
  until it gives us as a permission to continue.

- Step state: heap wide, tracks currently active "step into", "step over", or
  "step out" state.

The step state is rather tricky:

- Step over: track the original thread, activation index, and starting line.
  Execute in checked mode until starting line has changed; then pause.  If we
  call into other functions, the state is kept and we'll pause once we return
  and the line number has changed.

- Step into: track the original thread, activation index, and starting line.
  Execute in checked mode until starting line has changed.  If we call into
  another function, we need to pause when entering it.

- Step out: track the original thread and activation index (starting line does
  not matter).  Execute in normal mode (unless there are breakpoints, of course).
  If the activation is unwound for any reason, enter paused mode.  This means
  that if an error is thrown, we resume execution in the catcher.  Step out
  handling is concretely implemented as part of callstack unwinding, which
  differs completely from how other step commands are implemented.

  A coroutine yield does not trigger a "step out" because the callstack is not
  unwound.

Step over/into state is checked in executor "restart execution" operation.

Breakpoints
-----------

Breakpoints are maintained as a heap level file/line list.  When the bytecode
executor does a "restart execution" operation it rechecks the breakpoint list
and figures out which breakpoints are active; the active breakpoint list is
recorded into the heap state too.  Whenever breakpoint state may have changed,
e.g. as a result of executing debug commands, the bytecode executor must go
through a "restart execution" operation so that breakpoints are properly
re-checked and activated.

If there are one or more active breakpoints, execution resumes in checked mode.
If no breakpoints are active (and there's no other reason to be in checked
mode) execution resumes in normal mode.  This is important to maximize
execution performance when breakpoints are active but outside the currently
executing function.

One key problem in figuring out the active breakpoints is how to handle inner
functions.  This is covered in a separate section below.

Breakpoints are handled directly by Duktape to make them reasonably efficient.
Another design alternative would be to have an API or a protocol mechanism for
stepped execution so that user code could implement breakpoints on its own.
This would be more flexible than an integrated breakpoint mechanism, but also
much slower.

There are many design alternatives to defining a breakpoint using a file/line
pair.  The current file/line approach is intuitive but means that:

* There's no way to break in the middle of a single line, e.g. for one-line
  functions.  This also affects minified ECMAScript code.

* There are potentially multiple ECMAScript function instance (i.e.
  ``duk_hcompfunc`` objects) that have been created from the same spot.
  The breakpoint will match all of them.

Line transitions
----------------

It might seem at first that a line-to-PC conversion primitive would be needed
so that a line number could be translated into a PC for an active breakpoint.
However, such an approach doesn't really work, for several reasons, discussed
below.

Multiple instructions can be generated from a single line so that there are
several instructions with the same line number in the typical case.  The
opcodes mapping to a certain line number can also be scattered around the code
(not necessarily in a linear or localized fashion), e.g. for flow control
constructs.  Something like the following is entirely possible, and normal::

    PC      Line
    --      ----

    50      98
    51      99
    52      100   <--
    53      100   <--
    54      100   <--
    55      100   <--
    56      102
    57      103
    58      103
    59      104
    60      105
    61      100   <--

There may also be several PCs which are "entry points" for a certain line
number.  This happens with e.g. loop constructs.

A breakpoint may also be targeted on a line number which doesn't have any
matching bytecode instructions.  This can happen trivially when a breakpoint
is assigned to an empty line, but can also happen non-trivially when the line
numbers in the generated bytecode are off by one or otherwise unintuitive.
The expected behavior is often for the breakpoint to match when we transition
to the breakpoint line *or* over it.  There are several difficulties in using
this breakpoint rule however:

* There are potentially multiple "next lines" or "next opcodes".  Consider
  a breakpoint on an empty line in the middle of a switch statement.

* Using ``(prev_line < break_line) AND (curr_line >= break_line)`` as the
  rule to trigger a breakpoint works for the most part, but causes some
  unintuitive breakpoint behavior, especially when a breakpoint is in a
  conditional code block which is skipped but not executed.  See discussion
  in: https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/issues/263.  (Duktape 1.2.x used
  this breakpoint rule; the rule was changed in Duktape 1.3.x.)

The current rule (Duktape 1.3.x) for breakpoint triggering is::

    (prev_line != break_line) AND (curr_line == break_line)

In other words, a breakpoint is triggered when we transition to the exact
breakpoint line.  See discussion in
https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/issues/263.

Implementing breakpoints in terms of line transitions (instead of e.g. PC
values) also solves another related issue: once we hit a breakpoint on a
certain line, how to implement "step into" / "step over"?  Stepping away from
the breakpoint line means we need to execute bytecode instructions until
current line changes to a value different than the breakpoint line.  Note
that this is not necessarily the next line or even a higher line number
because control flow can maka a jump backwards.

So, right now Duktape implements breakpoints as follows:

* When one or more breakpoints is active, the bytecode executor enters checked
  execution.  In checked execution the bytecode interrupt mechanism is invoked
  before every opcode.  Checked execution is carefully avoided when at all
  possible, to ensure breakpoints don't slow down performance when they don't
  need to.

* The interrupt mechanism tracks line information (previous line, current line)
  so that it can detect line transitions.  This means Duktape will do a
  pc-to-line for every opcode executed.  This is currently not optimized and
  will consult the pc-to-line bitstream every time; see future work for notes
  on how this can be improved in the future.

* Breakpoints and stepping are checked when a line transition occurs, i.e.
  when ``prev_line != curr_line``.

Inner functions and breakpoints
-------------------------------

A breakpoint should only be active in the innermost function in the source
code.  Consider for example::

    1  function foo() {
    2      print('foo 1');
    3      function bar() {
    4          print('bar 1');
    5      }
    6      print('foo 2');
    7      bar();
    8  }
    9  foo();

Suppose execution was currently at line 2, and a breakpoint was added for
line 4.  What happens when you single step?

In a naive implementation the executor considers the line 4 breakpoint to
be active for the foo() activation, and when it detects a line transition
from line 2 to line 6, the breakpoint is triggered.  Execution stops at
line 6 before printing "foo 2".

To avoid this, a breakpoint is always associated (only) with the innermost
function where it appears.  This can be quickly detected by tracking the
line range (smallest and largest line number) for each function.  One can
then determine active breakpoints for a function FUNC as follows:

* If breakpoint has a different filename, reject.

* If breakpoint has line number is outside FUNC line range, reject.
  (For foo() line range would be 1-8 and for bar() line range would
  be 3-5.)

* Loop through all inner functions IFUNC of FUNC:

  - If breakpoint line number is inside IFUNC, reject.  IFUNC is
    considered to "capture" the breakpoint.

* Accept breakpoint as active for FUNC execution.

PC and line number handling
---------------------------

In internal book-keeping the PC field of a ``duk_activation`` refers to the
next instruction to execute.  This PC is not always the correct one to report.
Conceptually the previous instruction (PC-1) is sometimes still being executed
while sometimes we're in the middle of two opcodes, having finished execution
of PC-1.

The correct PC to use depends on context.  For example:

* In stack traces PC-1 is used for all callstack levels.  For activations
  below the callstack top PC-1 is the instruction still being executed (it
  is the call instruction).  For callstack top PC-1 is the "offending"
  instruction.

* For debugger Status notification PC is used because we've conceptually
  completed PC-1 and are about to execute PC.  Breakpoints also trigger
  at PC *before* the opcode at PC is executed.  In a debugger UI this means
  that the line highlighted is the next line to execute, and hasn't been
  executed yet.

* For debugger GetCallStack PC-1 is used for all callstack levels below
  the callstack top: as for stack traces, these call instructions are still
  being executed.  However, for callstack top PC is used to match Status,
  so that the line reported indicates what line will be executed next.

See: https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/issues/281.

Avoid nested message writing
----------------------------

Consider the following scenario:

* Debug client requests for local variable names and values using a
  hypothetical GetLocalVarsAndValues request.

* Duktape starts processing the request, streaming out a REP marker,
  followed by variable names and values.

* One of the variable values is a getter, and the request handler just
  uses a naive read to get the variable value, so that the getter is
  invoked.

* The getter calls ``print()`` which gets forwarded to the debug client.
  The ``print()`` handler writes a notification message containing the
  print data.

* This notification ends up in the middle of the GetLocalVarsAndValues
  response, corrupting the debug stream.

Such nested debug messages must be avoided at all times.  Some ways to
achieve this:

* If the debug command only deals with a single value (and not a list
  of values), read and coerce any values into safe form before streaming
  out the response.

* As a general rule favor side effect free debug commands, e.g. read
  values without invoking getters.

* For unsafe primitives that may have side effects, favor debug commands
  that just handle a single value (instead of an arbitrarily long list
  of values).  Such a primitive is easier to implement safely because it
  doesn't need to buffer a potentially unlimited list of safely obtained
  values before starting to write out the response.

* As a concrete example, the GetLocalVarsAndValues could be fixed either
  by:

  a. Changing it so that it doesn't invoke accessors.

  b. Changing it to return only a list of variable names, and adding a
     separate primitive to get the local variable value (GetLocalVar).
     This primitive can invoke getters, but it must do so before it
     starts to stream out the response.  Note that request pipelining
     allows local variables to read in two round trips: first read the
     variable names, then issue reads for every variable name in a big
     set of pipelined requests.

This issue affects various things here and there:

* If GC is invoked, it might be tempting to emit a GC notification from
  inside mark-and-sweep code.  This would be very unsafe because GC can
  easily be invoked by any operation involving the value stack.

Design goals
============

This section provides some notes on goals behind the debugger design (this is
not a comprehensive list).

Quick integration with a custom target
--------------------------------------

It should be possible integrate debugging support into a custom target
very quickly, e.g. in one day.

* This should be achievable with the current solution.  One needs to
  implement a custom transport into both the target device and duk_debug.js
  and can then use the debugger web UI to debug the target.

Minimize fragmentation of debug solutions
-----------------------------------------

The debugger architecture should ensure that improvements for Duktape
debugging capabilities are shared between users.  Ideally debug clients
developed for different environments could be mixed and matched.

* This is the main reason why a debug protocol is used as the basis of the
  design instead of a debug API.  A debug API would mean every user would
  need to define their own debug protocol, which would fragment both the
  debug protocol and, as a consequence, the debug clients.

* This goal is achieved to a large extent: any debug client should be able
  to talk with any target.  However, there may be need to adapt a transport
  mechanism so it's not completely automatic.

Transport neutrality
--------------------

The debug protocol should be transport neutral to support embedding in very
different environments and communication links (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, serial, etc).

* Concrete solution is to use assume a reliable (TCP-like) byte stream,
  with user code providing the concrete transport.

Transport bandwidth
-------------------

The debugger must work with slow transports, e.g. slow serial links.

* This is the reason a binary protocol is used: it's reasonably compact
  with no compression.  Compression is a possible solution but it is not
  preferable for very low memory devices (memory overhead).

The debugger must work with high latency transports (hundreds of
milliseconds).

* This is the reason why request pipelining is used: pipelining allows
  multiple commands to be sent, reducing blocking round trip waits.

* Pipelining allows debug commands to be built from small, simple
  operations with minimal additional latency (compared to a synchronous
  request/reply model).

Human readable protocol
-----------------------

It would be nice for the protocol to be human readable, e.g. plain text.

* This is currently not achieved as the debug protocol is binary.

* A binary protocol is used at the moment because it is more compact and
  has a smaller code footprint than parsing a text-based protocol.  Note
  that such parsing would need to be done without GC impact or other side
  effects so existing ECMAScript mechanisms (like number parsing) cannot
  necessarily be used as is.

Code footprint
--------------

Debugger support should be optional because it has a significant footprint.

It should be possible to enable debugger support even for very low memory
devices (e.g. 256kB flash).

* At the moment the additional code footprint for debugger support is around
  15-20 kB.

Memory (RAM) footprint and minimal churn
----------------------------------------

The debugger implementation should consume a minimal amount of RAM on top
of what the debug commands themselves need.

* Fixed allocations are preferable to variable allocations for low memory
  devices.

Debugger commands should avoid disturbing Duktape internal state.  For
instance, if a debug command requested a dump of the Duktape heap, the
command should cause no changes to the heap during serialization of the
response.  Concretely this means that:

* It must be possible to read and write debug messages without doing any
  memory allocations that can cause a GC.  This rules out, among other
  things, pushing values on the value stack and interning strings.  Memory
  allocations can be done using raw calls to allocation callbacks, but it's
  be preferable to be able to avoid memory allocations altogether.

* Note that it is *not* a requirement that all debug commands be implemented
  without side effects.  For instance, reading a variable may invoke a
  getter or use some internal mechanisms with side effects.  The goal is
  simply that it should be *possible* to write some debug commands that are
  side effect free if that is necessary.

Large and variable sized buffers for parsing inbound messages or constructing
outbound messages should be avoided.  These would be very problematic on low
memory devices.

* This goal is an important reason why the debug protocol uses a stream
  transport.  A stream transport allows e.g. the whole heap to be serialized
  with no variable sized output buffering: values are simply streamed out
  during the heap walk with a fixed streaming buffers.

* This goal is also one reason why the debug protocol is binary instead of
  e.g. JSON: JSON parsing would introduce significant memory churn if the
  current parser were used.  Adding a separate parser for debugging would
  be wasteful.

Performance
-----------

When a debugger is not attached (but debugger support is compiled in),
performance should be as close to normal as possible.

When a debugger is attached but there are no active breakpoints, performance
should be as close to normal as possible.

Performance with active breakpoints is not critical, but still matters on
slow targets so that timing sensitive applications have a chance of working
properly when debugged.

Miscellaneous design notes
==========================

Some design notes on miscellaneous issues, rejected alternatives, etc.

Debug commands instead of debug API
-----------------------------------

Instead of a debug protocol Duktape could provide a set of API primitives
to allow user code to implement a debugger on its own.  This would have
several downsides:

* There would need to be a lot of new public API primitives with deep access
  to Duktape internals.  Such an API would be a major maintenance issue going
  forwards: when Duktape internals change, there would still be old API
  promises to keep.  A debug protocol can hide the internal details more
  effectively.

* Every user application with a need for debugging would need to implement
  their own debug protocol: there would be no standard debug commands, just
  raw API calls which can be used to implement a debugger.  Every Duktape
  debugger integration would be different.

Impact of being an embeddable interpreter
-----------------------------------------

Embedded model means there is no standard launch like there is for a JVM
for instance.  The debugger needs to connect to a running instance, and
the launching of the instance is up to the user.  There may also not be
easy access to source code: the way it is loaded is up to the user, and
some of the source code is given from C code, perhaps programmatically.

It's up to the application to decide when the debugger is attached.  For
instance, a debugger may attached on startup (some kind of "reboot and
debug" mode) or only when debugger is attached at runtime.

Packet based protocol
---------------------

The debug transport could be based on delimited debug packets.  Both V8 and
Spidermonkey debug protocols are (JSON) packet based.

In a packet based protocol an inbound message needs to reside in memory to
be processed.  Similarly outbound messages are formed as full packets before
being sent.  This works poorly with low memory devices because it is difficult
to limit the maximum debug packet size:

* For example, even if a debug packet only contained a single string (perhaps
  an eval result), the size of the string may vary widely.  If debug packets
  have an upper size limit, it's quite easy to get into a situation where
  values that easily fit into memory cannot be sent over the debug protocol

* One can alleviate this problem by doing fragmented reads, i.e. the debug
  protocol allows the debug client to read in a string in chunks.  This has
  string life cycle issues, and such a fragmentation protocol is in fact
  emulating a stream transport in a crude way.

* A similar approach is needed for serializing object values, and potentially
  many other debug commands, which is very awkward from a protocol design
  perspective.

Stream protocol without request/response framing
------------------------------------------------

The debug protocol could also be a stream protocol with no request/response
framing.  This works poorly when either party may initiate messages without
lock step.  For example, if debug client sends a request and the target sends
a notification, how can the debug client know that the bytes it receives are
not a response but an unrelated notification?

Some framing is needed to at least separate responses from other messages.

Pipelining vs. asynchronous messages
------------------------------------

The current design is to allow pipelining of requests: each request has a
single reply (or error) and requests are never reordered.  There is no need
for request/reply identifiers in this model.

Another design would be to allow each party to send responses to incoming
commands in an arbitrary order (asynchronously).  This would be useful if
some operations took a long time and could be handled in the background
while more urgent operations could be processed in the meantime.

In practice this is difficult to implement especially on the debug target,
and would require more state tracking.  It would also make it more difficult
to send multiple requests (compared to pipelining) because there would be no
guarantee of their completion order.

Untyped debug message encoding
------------------------------

One alternative tried was to use untyped encoding for debug messages, i.e.
debug client and target both know what exact data messages are intended to
have, so there is no need to tag a value e.g. as an integer or a string.

This would be efficient but difficult to extend in a compatible fashion.
Instead, the debug protocol would need hard versioning for every minor
change and the debug client would need to support all protocol variants.
This is not necessarily a showstopper though as the debug client will need
to have version awareness anyway.

Variable size integer encoding
------------------------------

The debug protocol exchanges a lot of small and large integers.  The
extended UTF-8 encoding was used first which is consistent with other
variable length integer encoding in Duktape.

However, when the current tag initial byte (IB) was added, it became very
natural to use the tag byte to encode small integers and to encode the
byte length of larger integers.  This representation is actually quite
similar to CBOR: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049.

Accessors and proxies vs. variable get/set
------------------------------------------

* Triggering setters / getters may not be desirable.

* Perhaps return value like Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(), and allow
  debug client to invoke the getter if necessary?  (Heap walking provides
  a similar feature now.)

* Access proxy and target separately?

Other debugger implementations
==============================

Overview
--------

Both V8 and Spidermonkey use a packet based debug protocol with much of the
protocol formatted in JSON.  Although this is quite an intuitive approach,
Duktape uses a stream based binary protocol to avoid the memory churn related
to using JSON, and to better support very low memory devices where forming
complete debug messages in memory would be problematic.

Chrome/V8
---------

Chrome/V8 uses a packet based debug protocol where each packet is a JSON
message:

* https://code.google.com/p/v8-wiki/wiki/DebuggerProtocol

Also see:

* https://code.google.com/p/chromedevtools/wiki/ChromeDevToolsProtocol

* https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging

Firefox
-------

Mozilla uses a packet based debug protocol where packets are either JSON or
binary blobs.  It can be mapped to a stream:

* https://wiki.mozilla.org/Remote_Debugging_Protocol_Stream_Transport

Also see:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Debugging_JavaScript

Eclipse
-------

An Eclipse debugger could be implemented using the Duktape debugger protocol.

* http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Debugger/how-to.html

Known issues
============

Valgrind uninitialized byte(s) warning
--------------------------------------

You may get the following when doing a DumpHeap::

    ==17318== Syscall param write(buf) points to uninitialised byte(s)
    ==17318==    at 0x5466700: __write_nocancel (syscall-template.S:81)
    ==17318==    by 0x427ADA: duk_trans_socket_write_cb (duk_trans_socket_unix.c:237)
    ==17318==    by 0x403538: duk_debug_write_bytes.isra.11 (duk_debugger.c:379)
    ==17318==    by 0x4036AC: duk_debug_write_strbuf (duk_debugger.c:463)
    [...]

When unpacked duk_tval is in use, all bytes of a duk_tval are not necessarily
set when a certain value is written into the duk_tval.  This is not a safety
issue because Duktape won't read or use the uninitialized bytes in ordinary
situations.  However, the uninitialized bytes in the 'data' area of a
compiled function will be written out by DumpHeap as is, causing the above
(harmless) valgrind gripe.

Future work
===========

Error handling
--------------

Add error handling wrappers to debug code.  For instance, if we run out of
memory, detach automatically as a recovery measure?

Currently unsafe behavior may be triggered by internal errors (e.g. out of
memory) or, for instance, a getter error triggered by GetVar.

Fast pc-to-line for checked execution
-------------------------------------

During checked execution we need to figure out the line number for the current
PC so that line transitions can be tracked accurately.  Right now the pc-to-line
bitstream is consulted statelessly each time, which is slow (but only affects
checked execution, i.e. when there's an active breakpoint for the current
function).

There are several ways to make this faster:

* Cache the pc-to-line conversion state.  If the PC increases by one, we can
  almost always just decode a single line delta from the bitstream which is
  very efficient and requires no data format changes.

* When entering checked execution, create an unpacked pc-to-line array so that
  lookups can be done as simple array lookups.

* When debugging is enabled, store pc-to-line conversion information as a plain
  array in general.  This has a memory footprint impact for all functions, even
  when a debugger is not attached (but Duktape debugger support is compiled in)
  so this approach is not very desirable.

* Emit explicit line transition opcodes.  This has a memory and performance
  impact, even when a debugger is not attached, so this approach is also not
  very desirable.

Improve compiler line number accuracy
-------------------------------------

The ECMAScript compiler assigns line numbers to bytecode opcodes emitted, and
doesn't always do a perfect job in doing so.  There are a few cases where the
line number for a statement can be off by one (matching a previous statement)
which looks funny in the debugger UI.

The underlying issue is that the compiler emits bytecode opcodes both when
the active token is in the "previous token" and the "current token" slot.
Expression parsing usually has the active token in the previous token slot,
while statement parsing (especially when parsing the initial keyword) has
the active token in the current token slot.  This needs some reworking to
be fixed properly.

Source code
-----------

Source code handling is currently outside of Duktape scope, and we simply
assume that the proper source file can be located based on a "fileName"
property of a running function.

There are many future options:

* Download from target device (same as where code was originally loaded)

* Store source when compiling in debug mode, possibly using some trivial
  compression to reduce the memory impact

* Identify source code text using a hash computed on the target, so that
  the corresponding source can be located more reliably

Source maps
-----------

It's a common practice to minify Javascript code.  Line number information
is often lost in the process, and this makes the code difficult to debug for
a variety of reasons:

* Source code readability is poor

* Breakpoint mechanisms targeting file/line work very poorly

Source maps record the original line number information:

* http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/

If Duktape supported source maps, a source map could be taken into account
during compilation and function pc-to-line mapping could refer to the original
unminified source code which would be much more debugger friendly.

More flexible pausing
---------------------

Various triggers for pausing could be added:

* Pause on function entry/exit

* Pause on next statement

* Pause on yield/resume

* Pause on execution timeout

More flexible stepping
----------------------

Additional stepping parameters could be implemented:

* Step one PC at a time

* Step for N bytecode instructions

* Step for roughly N milliseconds

Dynamically declared variables in local variable list
-----------------------------------------------------

The local variable list returned by GetLocals does not include dynamically
declared variables, or variables with a scope smaller than the entire
function::

  function test() {
      var foo = 123;   // 'foo' is included

      eval('var bar = 321');  // 'bar' is not included

      try {
          throw 'foo';
      } catch (e) {
          // 'e' is not included
      }
  }

This should be fixed so that the locals include dynamic variables too.
This is especially important for try-catch.

The Eval command can read/write dynamic variables too, so the current
workaround is to use Eval.  For instance, in the catch clause, Eval
``"e"`` to read the error caught.

Expression dependent breakpoints
--------------------------------

Pause when an expression evaluates to a truthy value.

Watch expressions
-----------------

Watch expressions are currently implemented by the debug client using the
Eval command.

For example, the debugger web UI implements automatic eval for a single
expression.  The expression is automatically evaluated when Duktape becomes
paused.  This is easy to extend for multiple watch expressions.

Notifications on internal events
--------------------------------

Send a notification when interesting internal events occur, like:

* Ordinary GC

* Emergency GC

* Thread creation

* Thread destruction

* Execution timeout

These must be implemented very carefully.  For instance, if we're currently
in the process of responding to some debug command (say, "get locals") and
GC is triggered, the GC notify cannot be sent inline from the mark-and-sweep
code because it might then appear in the middle of the "get locals" response.
Instead, events need to be flagged, based on counters, or queued.

Possible new commands or command improvements
---------------------------------------------

* More comprehensive callstack inspection, at least on par with what a stack
  trace provides

* Resume with error, i.e. inject error

* Enumerate threads in heap

* Enumerate all objects in heap

* Status for success/failure of PutVar

* Error handling for PutVar

* Avoid side effects (getter invocation) in GetVar

Direct support for structured values
------------------------------------

The current mapping between ``duk_tval`` values and dvalues works but it
cannot represent structured types.  For instance, if a hypothetical debug
command to set a global variable reads the value argument as a dvalue, it
cannot write a value like ``[1,2,3]`` into the global variable.

This can of course be worked out by doing an ``eval()`` for the argument
or by representing the value as JSON (which is more or less the same thing).

Another alternative is to add support for representing structured values
directly with dvalues, so that when C code does a::

    duk_debug_read_tval(thr);

an arbitrarily complex object value (perhaps even an arbitrary object graph)
can be decoded and pushed to the value stack.

Heap walking support alleviates this problem for the cases where the
structured data resides or can be placed in the Duktape heap.

Heap dump viewer
----------------

The DumpHeap command provides a snapshot of all heap objects, which the
debugger web UI converts into a JSON dump.  It'd be nice to include a viewer
for the dump, so that it'd be easy to traverse the object graph, look for
strings and values, etc.

Eclipse debugger
----------------

An Eclipse debugger would be very useful as it's a very popular IDE for
embedded development.  There are already integrations for Visual Studio Code.

Breakpoint handling in attach/detach
------------------------------------

Currently the list of breakpoints is not cleared by attach or detach, so if
you detach and then re-attach, old breakpoints are still set.  The debug
client can just delete all breakpoints on attach, but it'd be cleaner to
remove the breakpoints on either attach or detach.

Indicate fastint status
-----------------------

When debugging code that is intended to operate with fastints, it would be
useful to see when a value is internally represented as a fastint vs. a full
IEEE double.  Currently this information is not conveyed by the protocol, and
all fastints appear like any other number values.

Buffer object support
---------------------

Make it easier to see buffer object contents (like for plain buffers), either
by serializing them differently, or through heap walking.

Separate callback for checking transport status
-----------------------------------------------

When Duktape is in the running state (not paused), Duktape will only call:

* The peek callback periodically to see if there is anything to read.
  There's no way to indicate a transport detach/error with peek now.

* The write callback periodically, as a side effect of sending Status
  notifies.  This is the main mechanism now for detecting a broken
  transport in the running state.  If Status notifies were removed,
  Duktape would not notice a transport break unless something else prompted
  a write to the debug transport.

It might be cleaner to provide either:

* A callback to check transport status explicitly and perhaps allows even
  an error message to be indicated.

* Allow user code to proactively call into Duktape to indicate the transport
  is broken (beyond calling ``duk_debugger_detach()``).

However, for some transports it may not be possible to get transport status
information without actually attempting a write.  This may be caused by the
nature of the transport or an underlying platform API limitation, for example.
So, such a transport status callback must be optional, and it may still be
necessary to ensure a periodic write (a "keepalive" if nothing else) to detect
transport errors in such cases.

Extend ERR message with a programmatic string error code
--------------------------------------------------------

Current error messages have the form::

    ERR <error number> <message> EOM

The number space is awkward to manage modularly, and doesn't work well for
application specific errors which would be useful for e.g. AppRequest
messages.  Extend the error format to::

    ERR <error number> <error string code> <message> EOM

String codes could follow an all caps convention like ``"NOT_FOUND"``::

    ERR 3 "NOT_FOUND" "breakpoint not found" EOM

String error codes are easy to extend without conflicts like one has with
a numbered sequence.

Change callstack entries to avoid getter invocations
----------------------------------------------------

With heap walking in place callstack variable dump could provide the necessary
information to distinguish data and accessor properties and let the debug
client decide if getters are to be invoked.

Callstack primitives could also return the variable list in a format matching
the GetHeapObjInfo command, i.e. as a key/value list which also provides
support for artificial properties and property flags.

Replace GetBytecode with object inspection
------------------------------------------

The GetBytecode command could be removed by providing a reference to the
current function and then using object inspection to get the bytecode data
currently returned in GetBytecode -- that is, the bytecode, constants, etc.

Improve garbage collection behavior during paused state
-------------------------------------------------------

Current behavior: garbage generated during paused state (refzero or objects
in reference loops) will both be left in the heap and collected eventually
by mark-and-sweep.

Various improvements are possible, see discussion in
https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/pull/617.
