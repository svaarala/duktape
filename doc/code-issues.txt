This documents covers C coding issues related to Duktape implementation
such as:

* Conventions
* Portability concerns
* Specific platforms and compilers
* Size and performance optimization issues

Conventions
===========

Indentantion, naming, etc
-------------------------

Indent with tab.  On continuation lines indent with tab to shared indent
depth and then indent with spaces.  For example, denoting tab indent with
colon and space indent with period::

  ::::::::snprintf(buf,
  ::::::::.........sizeof(buf), 
  ::::::::........."%d",
  ::::::::.........123);

Names are lowercase, underscore separated::

  void duk_func(void) {
          /* ... */
  }

Macros are uppercase, underscore separated::

  #define  DUK_MACRO(x)  /* ... */

Comments are always traditional C comments, never ``//``::

  /* always used traditional C comments */

Opening brace on the same line as the start of the construct, even
for functions::

  void func(int x) {
          if (x) {
                  /* ... */
          } else {
                  /* ... */
          }
  }

The case-statements of a switch are at the same level as the switch
to reduce indent.  If case clauses have their own blocks, this leads
to a confusing closing brace, so a comment for that may be in order::

  switch (x) {
  case A: {
          /* ... */
          break;
  }
  case B: {
          /* ... */
          break;
  }
  default: {
  }
  }  /* switch */

Space after ``if``, ``switch``, etc::

  if (x) { ... }   /* correct */
  if(x) { ... }    /* incorrect */

  switch (x) { ... }  /* correct */
  switch(x) { ... }   /* incorrect */

Use of goto for error cleanup and shared error handling is not only
allowed but encouraged.

No naked statements in e.g. ``if-then-else``, always use a block.
This is more macro compatible.  Example::

  if (x) {
          return 1;  /* correct */
  }

  if (x)
          return 1;  /* incorrect */

Multi-statement macros should use a ``do-while(0)`` construct::

  #define  FROBNICATE(x,y)  do { \
                  x = x * x; \
                  y = y * y; \
          } while (0)

Include guards
--------------

There are multiple include guard conventions.  Leading underscores are
reserved and should be avoided in user code.  The current include guard
convention is::

  /* duk_foo.h */

  #ifndef DUK_FOO_H_INCLUDED
  #define DUK_FOO_H_INCLUDED

  ...

  #endif  /* DUK_FOO_H_INCLUDED */

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard

``#pragma once`` is not portable, and is not used.

Unused variables
----------------

Suppressing unused variable warnings use the following macro::

  DUK_UNREF(my_unused_var);

Internally, this currently uses the form::

  (void) my_unused_var;  /* suppress warning */

This seems to work with both GCC and Clang.  The form::

  my_unused_var = my_unused_var;  /* suppress warning */

works with GCC but not with Clang.

Portability concerns
====================

Platforms and compilers
=======================

VBCC
----

Even in C99 mode VBCC 0.9b:

* Does not have ``inttypes.h``.

* Does not have ``fpclassify()`` and friends.

* Does not have ``NAN`` or ``INFINITY``.

* The expression ``0.0 / 0.0`` causes a warning and results in ``0.0``
  instead of ``NaN`` as expected.

* The expression ``1.0 / 0.0`` causes a warning and results in ``0.0``
  instead of infinity as expected.

The following program demonstrates the NaN issue::

  #include <stdio.h>

  void main(void) {
      double z = 0.0;
      double t;
      volatile union {
          double d;
          unsigned char b[8];
      } u;
      int i;
  
      /* this results in 0.0 */
      t = 0.0 / 0.0;
      printf("result: %lf\n", t);
  
      /* this results in NaN */
      t = z / z;
      printf("result: %lf\n", t);
      
      u.d = t;
      for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
          printf("%02x\n", u.b[i]);
      }
  }

To work with compiler optimization, the above approach needs to have the
``double`` values in ``volatile`` variables.  Otherwise VBCC will end up
replacing the result with zero.  So something like this is probably safest::

  volatile double a = 0.0;
  volatile double b = 0.0;
  double t = a / b;  /* -> NaN */
