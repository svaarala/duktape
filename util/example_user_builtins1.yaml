#
#  Example of user-supplied built-in strings and objects
#
#  Top level keys:
#
#    - add_forced_strings: provide a list of keys to be forced into ROM
#    - objects: objects to add, replace, delete, or modify
#
#  See examples below for details on how to use these.
#
#  Note that genbuiltins.py (and make_dist.py) accepts multiple user built-in
#  YAML files, so that you can manage your custom strings and objects in
#  individual YAML files for modularity.
#
#  When using pointer compression, all ROM strings and objects need a number
#  from the ROM pointer compression range (e.g. [0xf800,0xffff]).  By default
#  there is space for ~1000 user strings and objects.  You can tweak the range
#  starting point if you need more space.
#

# Strings that must be included in ROM even if not referenced by any
# built-in object.  String data is in a raw format where Unicode codepoints
# U+0000...U+00FF are identified with exact bytes in the string (allows
# invalid UTF-8 so that internal strings can be represented).  Placing
# strings in ROM avoids interning them if they're encountered at run time;
# you can e.g. add function and constant names used in custom Ecmascript
# bindings.
#
# NOTE: You don't need to list any keys of custom built-in objects here
# as those strings will automatically be included in ROM strings.  Duplicates
# are eliminated automatically so it's still safe to include strings here
# "just in case".

add_forced_strings:

  # If numbers are often string coerced it might be useful to add e.g.
  # numbers 0-9 or 0-99.

  - str: "0"
  - str: "1"
  - str: "2"
  - str: "3"
  - str: "4"
  - str: "5"
  - str: "6"
  - str: "7"
  - str: "8"
  - str: "9"

  # Non-ascii strings: encode into UTF-8, map bytes to U+0000...U+00FF.
  #
  # >>> u'säätö'.encode('utf-8').encode('hex')
  # '73c3a4c3a474c3b6'

  - str: "s\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4t\u00c3\u00b6"

  # Custom run-time constants are useful to add (if they're not already
  # present as keys of any builtin-in object).

  - str: "Led1"
  - str: "Led2"
  - str: "Led3"
  - str: "Led4"
  - str: "Led5"
  - str: "Led6"
  - str: "Led7"
  - str: "Led8"

  # In general, any strings that may be used frequently can be added,
  # at the cost of increasing ROM footprint and reducing RAM footprint
  # (the tradeoff is quite close to 1:1, i.e. memory usage moves from
  # RAM to ROM but does not decrease as such).
  #
  # You can find eligible strings in many ways, e.g. by grepping source
  # code, or by adding a few debug prints to Duktape string intern code.

  - str: "Content-Type"
  - str: "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
  - str: "Arglebargle, glop-glyf!?!"
  - str: "Do you want your possessions identified?"
  - str: "Project Marathon"
  - str: "Motel Key"
  - str: "Bus Ticket"
  - str: "foo"
  - str: "bar"
  - str: "quux"
  - str: "baz"

# Objects to add, replace, delete, or modify:
#
#   - If the object entry contains 'delete': true', the object will be
#     deleted.  Error if the object doesn't exist.
#
#   - If the object entry contains 'replace: true', the object will be
#     replaced; if the object doesn't exist it'll be added with a warning.
#
#   - If the object entry contains 'modify: true', the object will be
#     modified incrementally.  Error if the object doesn't exist.
#
#   - If the object entry contains 'add: true', the object will be added.
#     Error if the object already exists.  This is the default if no keys
#     listed above are given.

objects:

  # Example of adding an object.  Properties may reference other objects using
  # the 'id' strings even if the object hasn't been introduced yet (and may be
  # introduced by a different user builtins YAML file).
  #
  # Add a built-in object with plain property values.  This just creates the
  # built-in object; for the object to be actually useful you must use e.g.
  # 'modify: true' to add a reference to the object to some existing object
  # reachable from the global object (see below for an example pointing to
  # this object).
  #
  # (In more detail, it's sufficient for the custom object to be reachable
  # from any object with a 'bidx', but in practice objects are reachable
  # directly on indirectly through the global object.)

  - id: bi_star_trek
    add: true
    class: Object  # recommended for objects
    internal_prototype: bi_object_prototype  # recommended so that e.g. .toString() works

    # Because we don't give explicit property attributes here, defaults
    # (writable, configurable, not enumerable) are used automatically.

  # Example of plain value types supported at the moment:
  #
  # - Object, function, lightfunc, and accessor types not illustrated
  #   here (see src/builtins.yaml for examples of those).
  #
  # - Duktape buffer and pointer types cannot be used by built-in
  #   objects at the moment.
  #
  # - The "null" type is supported for ROM init data but not for RAM
  #   init data.  Null values are replaced with "undefined" for RAM
  #   init data at the moment (with a build warning).
  #
  # - One simple way of coming up with exact IEEE doubles is to use
  #   Python:
  #
  #       import struct
  #       print(struct.pack('>d', 12345.6789).encode('hex'))

  # Example of how to delete an existing built-in object entirely.  Dangling

  #
  # Deleting user objects may be useful e.g. if a base YAML file provides your

  # needed for a certain target.

  # Examples of modifying an object, i.e. augment top level metadata, add
  # property, delete property, or modify a property.  You can operate on the
  # same object multiple times in the same 'objects' list.
  #
  # Top level keys other than 'properties' are copied over the existing object
  # so that you can e.g. change the class of an object.
  #
  # Property list is then walked in order.
  #
  # If a property has "delete: true" the property is deleted:
  #
  #   - If the key doesn't exist in the existing object, ignore silently.
  #
  #   - If the key exists, delete the property.
  #
  # Otherwise the property is added/modified:
  #
  #   - If the key already exists the existing property is replaced
  #     (and keeps its enumeration position).
  #
  #   - If the key doesn't exist the property is added to the end of
  #     the property list.
  #
  # XXX: At present there's no support for reordering properties which would
  # be nice because it affects enumeration order (and may affect performance
  # marginally).
