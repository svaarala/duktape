<h1 id="custombehavior">Custom behavior</h1>

<p>This section summarizes Duktape behavior which deviates from the E5.1
specification.</p>

<h2>Duktape built-in</h2>

<p>The <code>Duktape</code> built-in is (of course) non-standard and provides
access to Duktape specific features.</p>

<h2>Additional Error and Function object properties</h2>

<p>See
<a href="#errorobjects">Error objects</a> and
<a href="functionobjects">Function objects</a>.</p>

<p>Non-strict function instances don't have a <code>caller</code> property in the
E5/E5.1 specification.  Some real world code expects to have this property, so it
can be enabled with the feature option <code>DUK_OPT_FUNC_NONSTD_CALLER_PROPERTY</code>.</p>

<h2>Function statements</h2>

<p>E5.1 does not allow a function declaration to appear outside program or
function top level:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function test() {
    // point A
    try {
        throw new Error('test');
    } catch (e) {
        // This is a SyntaxError in E5.1
        function func() {
            print(typeof e);
        }
        // point B
    }
    // point C
}
</pre>

<p>These declarations are also referred to as "function statements", and appear
quite often in real world code (including the test262 test suite), so they are
allowed by Duktape.  Unfortunately there are several semantics used by different
Javascript engines.  Duktape follows the V8 behavior for function statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strict function: a SyntaxError is thrown (standard behavior).</li>
<li>Non-strict function: treat a function statement like an ordinary function
    declaration, conceptually "hoisting" it to the top of the function.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an illustration, the above example would behave as the following:</p>
<pre class="ecmascript-code">
function test() {
    function func() {
        print(typeof e);
    }
 
    try {
        throw new Error('test');
    } catch (e) {
    }
}
</pre>

<p><code>func()</code> in the above example would already be declared
and callable in point A, and would not have access to the <code>e</code>
binding in any of the points A, B, or C.</p>

<h2>RegExp leniency</h2>

<p>Although not allowed by E5.1, the following escape is allowed in RegExp
syntax:</p>
<pre>
  /\$/       /* matches dollar literally, non-standard */
  /\u0024/   /* same, standard */
</pre>

<p>This escape occurs in real world code so it is allowed.  (More leniency
will be added in future versions to deal with real world RegExps; dollar
escapes are not the only issue.)</p>

<h2>Array.prototype.splice() when deleteCount not given</h2>

<p>When deleteCount (the 2nd argument) is not given to <code>Array.prototype.splice()</code>,
the standard behavior is to work as if the 2nd argument was <code>undefined</code>
(or 0, which has the same behavior after coercions).  A more real world compatible
behavior is to treat the missing argument like positive infinity, i.e. to extend
the splice operation to the end of the array.</p>

<p>Because the non-standard real world behavior is expected by much existing code,
Duktape uses this behavior by default.  The strict standards compliant behavior can
be enabled with the feature option <code>DUK_OPT_NO_ARRAY_SPLICE_NONSTD_DELCOUNT</code>.</p>
