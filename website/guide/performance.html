<p>Duktape is an interpreted engine with currently no JIT support.  It uses
reference counting which makes memory usage tight at the cost of some execution
performance.  Overall Duktape performance should be similar to other interpreted
languages.</p>

for discussion of Duktape performance characteristics and hints to optimize code
for performance.</p>
