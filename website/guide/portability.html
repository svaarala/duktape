<h1 id="portability">Portability</h1>

<p>Duktape is widely portable to platforms with at least a C89 compiler.
Because Duktape has very limited dependency on platform functions, it's
possible to Duktape to very exotic platforms.  One major platform dependency
is the Date built-in which may need a custom provider for an exotic platform.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://wiki.duktape.org/Portability.html">Portability</a> for
platform and compiler specific portability issues, porting recommendations,
and troubleshooting tips.</p>
