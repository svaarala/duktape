<h2 id="type-memory-allocations">Memory allocations</h2>

<p>The following stack types involve additional heap allocations:</p>

<ul>
<li>String: a single allocation contains a combined heap and string header,
    followed by the immutable string data.</li>
<li>Object: one allocation is used for a combined heap and object header,
    and another allocation is used for object properties.  The property
    allocation contains both array entries and normal properties, and if
    the object is large enough, a hash table to speed up lookups.</li>
<li>Buffer: for fixed buffers a single allocation contains a combined heap
    and buffer header, followed by the mutable fixed-size buffer.  For
    dynamic buffers the current buffer is allocated separately.  For
    external buffers a single heap object is allocated and points to
    a user buffer.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Note that while strings and buffers are considered a primitive (pass-by-value)
types, they are a heap allocated type from a memory allocation viewpoint.</p>

<h2 id="type-pointer-stability">Pointer stability</h2>

<p>Heap objects allocated by Duktape have stable pointers: the objects are
not relocated in memory while they are reachable from a garbage collection
point of view.  This is the case for the main heap object, but not
necessarily for any additional allocations related to the object, such as
dynamic property tables or dynamic buffer data area.  A heap object is
reachable e.g. when it resides on the value stack of a reachable thread or
is reachable through the global object.  Once a heap object becomes
unreachable any pointers held by user C code referring to the object are
unsafe and should no longer be dereferenced.</p>

<p>In practice the only heap allocated data directly referenced by user code
are strings, fixed buffers, and dynamic buffers.  The data area of strings
and fixed buffers is stable; it is safe to keep a C pointer referring to the
data even after a Duktape/C function returns as long the string or fixed
buffer remains reachable from a garbage collection point of view at all times.
Note that this is <i>not</i> the case for Duktape/C value stack arguments, for
instance, unless specific arrangements are made.</p>

<p>The data area of a dynamic buffer does <b>not</b> have a stable pointer.
The buffer itself has a heap header with a stable address but the current
buffer is allocated separately and potentially relocated when the buffer
is resized.  It is thus unsafe to hold a pointer to a dynamic buffer's data
area across a buffer resize, and it's probably best not to hold a pointer
after a Duktape/C function returns (as there would be no easy way of being
sure that the buffer hadn't been resized).  The data area of an external
buffer also has a potentially changing pointer, but the pointer is only
changed by an explicit user API call.</p>

<p>For external buffers the stability of the data pointer is up to the user
code which sets and updates the pointer.</p>

<h2 id="type-masks">Type masks</h2>

<p>Type masks allows calling code to easily check whether a type belongs to
a certain type set.  For instance, to check that a certain stack value is
a number, string, or an object:</p>

<pre class="c-code">
if (duk_get_type_mask(ctx, -3) &amp; (DUK_TYPE_MASK_NUMBER |
                                  DUK_TYPE_MASK_STRING |
                                  DUK_TYPE_MASK_OBJECT)) {
    printf("type is number, string, or object\n");
}
</pre>

<p>There is a specific API call for matching a set of types even more
conveniently:</p>

<pre class="c-code">
if (duk_check_type_mask(ctx, -3, DUK_TYPE_MASK_NUMBER |
                                 DUK_TYPE_MASK_STRING |
                                 DUK_TYPE_MASK_OBJECT)) {
    printf("type is number, string, or object\n");
}
</pre>

<p>These are faster and more compact than the alternatives:</p>

<pre class="c-code">
// alt 1
if (duk_is_number(ctx, -3) || duk_is_string(ctx, -3) || duk_is_object(ctx, -3)) {
    printf("type is number, string, or object\n");
}

// alt 2
int t = duk_get_type(ctx, -3);
if (t == DUK_TYPE_NUMBER || t == DUK_TYPE_STRING || t == DUK_TYPE_OBJECT) {
    printf("type is number, string, or object\n");
}
</pre>

<h2 id="type-none">None</h2>

<p>The <b>none</b> type is not actually a type but is used in the API to
indicate that a value does not exist, a stack index is invalid, etc.</p>

<h2 id="type-undefined">Undefined</h2>

<p>The <b>undefined</b> type maps to Ecmascript <code>undefined</code>, which is
distinguished from a <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Values read from outside the active value stack range read back as
<b>undefined</b>.</p>

<h2 id="type-null">Null</h2>

<p>The <b>null</b> type maps to Ecmascript <code>null</code>.</p>

<h2 id="type-boolean">Boolean</h2>

<p>The <b>boolean</b> type is represented in the C API as an integer: zero for false,
and non-zero for true.</p>

<p>Whenever giving boolean values as arguments in API calls, any non-zero value is
accepted as a "true" value.  Whenever API calls return boolean values, the value
<code>1</code> is always used for a "true" value.  This allows certain C idioms to be
used.  For instance, a bitmask can be built directly based on API call return values,
as follows:
</p>

<pre class="c-code">
/* this works and generates nice code */
int bitmask = (duk_get_boolean(ctx, -3) &lt;&lt; 2) |
              (duk_get_boolean(ctx, -2) &lt;&lt; 1) |
              duk_get_boolean(ctx, -1);

/* more verbose variant not relying on "true" being represented by 1 */
int bitmask = ((duk_get_boolean(ctx, -3) ? 1 : 0) &lt;&lt; 2) |
              ((duk_get_boolean(ctx, -2) ? 1 : 0) &lt;&lt; 1) |
              (duk_get_boolean(ctx, -1) ? 1 : 0);

/* another verbose variant */
int bitmask = (duk_get_boolean(ctx, -3) ? (1 &lt;&lt; 2) : 0) |
              (duk_get_boolean(ctx, -2) ? (1 &lt;&lt; 1) : 0) |
              (duk_get_boolean(ctx, -1) ? 1 : 0);
</pre>

<h2 id="type-number">Number</h2>

<p>The <b>number</b> type is an IEEE double, including +/- Infinity and NaN values.
Zero sign is also preserved.  An IEEE double represents all integers up to 53 bits
accurately.</p>

<p>IEEE double allows NaN values to have additional signaling bits.  Because these
bits are used by Duktape internal tagged type representation (when using 8-byte
packed values), NaN values in the Duktape API are normalized.  Concretely, if you
push a certain NaN value to the value stack, another (normalized) NaN value may
come out.  Don't rely on NaNs preserving their exact form.</p>

<h2 id="type-string">String</h2>

<!-- FIXME: update extended UTF-8 description and tables, extended UTF-8 just
means UTF_8 + CESU-8 extras -->

<p>The <b>string</b> type is an arbitrary byte sequence of a certain length which
may contain internal NUL (0x00) values.  Strings are always automatically NUL
terminated for C coding convenience.  The NUL terminator is not counted as part
of the string length.  For instance, the string <code>"foo"</code> has byte length 3
and is stored in memory as <code>{ 'f', 'o', 'o', '\0' }</code>.  Because of the
guaranteed NUL termination, strings can always be pointed to using a simple
<code>const char *</code> as long as internal NULs are not an issue; if they are,
the explicit byte length of the string can be queried with the API.  Calling code
can refer directly to the string data held by Duktape.  Such string data
pointers are valid (and stable) for as long as a string is reachable in the
Duktape heap.</p>

<p>Strings are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">interned</a>
for efficiency: only a single copy of a certain string ever exists at a time.
Strings are immutable and must NEVER be changed by calling C code.  Doing so will
lead to very mysterious issues which are hard to diagnose.</p>

<p>Calling code most often deals with Ecmascript strings, which may contain
arbitrary 16-bit codepoints in the range U+0000 to U+FFFF but cannot represent
non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">BMP</a>
codepoints.  This is how strings are defined in the Ecmascript standard.
In Duktape, Ecmascript strings are encoded with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CESU-8">CESU-8</a> encoding.  CESU-8
matches <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> except that it
allows codepoints in the surrogate pair range (U+D800 to U+DFFF) to be encoded
directly (prohibited in UTF-8).  CESU-8, like UTF-8, encodes all 7-bit ASCII
characters as-is which is convenient for C code.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>U+0041 ("A") encodes to <code>41</code>.</li>
<li>U+1234 (ETHIOPIC SYLLABLE SEE) encodes to <code>e1 88 b4</code>.</li>
<li>U+D812 (high surrogate) encodes to <code>ed a0 92</code>. This would be
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Invalid_code_points">invalid UTF-8</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="extended-utf8"></a>
<p>Duktape also uses extended strings internally.  Codepoints up to U+10FFFF
can be represented with UTF-8, and codepoints above that up to full 32 bits
can be represented with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Extending_from_31_bit_to_36_bit_range">extended UTF-8</a>.
Non-standard strings are used for storing internal object properties; using a
non-standard string ensures that such properties never conflict with properties
accessible using standard Ecmascript strings.  Non-standard strings can be given
to Ecmascript built-in functions, but since behavior may not be exactly
specified, results may vary.</p>

<p>The extended UTF-8 encoding used by Duktape is described in the table below.
The leading byte is shown in binary (with "x" marking data bits) while
continuation bytes are marked with "C" (indicating the bit sequence 10xxxxxx):</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header"><th>Codepoint range</th><th>Bits</th><th>Byte sequence</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>U+0000 to U+007F</td><td>7</td><td>0xxxxxxx</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+0080 to U+07FF</td><td>11</td><td>110xxxxx C</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+0800 to U+FFFF</td><td>16</td><td>1110xxxx C C</td><td>U+D800 to U+DFFF allowed (unlike UTF-8)</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+1 0000 to U+1F FFFF</td><td>21</td><td>11110xxx C C C</td><td>Above U+10FFFF allowed (unlike UTF-8)</td></tr>
<tr><td>U+20 0000 to U+3FF FFFF</td><td>26</td><td>111110xx C C C C</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+400 0000 to U+7FFF FFFF</td><td>31</td><td>1111110x C C C C C</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>U+8000 0000 to U+F FFFF FFFF</td><td>36</td><td>11111110 C C C C C C</td><td>Only 32 bits used in practice (up to U+FFFF FFFF)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The downside of the encoding for codepoints above U+7FFFFFFF is that
the leading byte will be <code>0xFE</code> which conflicts with Unicode byte order
marker encoding.  This is not a practical concern in Duktape's internal use.</p>

<p>The leading <code>0xFF</code> byte never appears in Duktape's extended UTF-8
encoding, and is used to implement <a href="#internalproperties">internal properties</a>.</p>

<h2 id="type-object">Object</h2>

<p>The <b>object</b> type includes Ecmascript objects and arrays, functions,
threads (coroutines), and buffer objects.  In other words, anything with
properties is an object.  Properties are key-value pairs with a string key
and an arbitrary value (including <b>undefined</b>).</p>

<p>Objects may participate in garbage collection finalization.</p>

<h2 id="type-buffer">Buffer</h2>

<p>The plain <b>buffer</b> type is a raw buffer for user data.  It's much
more memory efficient than standard buffer object types like ArrayBuffer
or Node.js Buffer.  There are three plain buffer sub-types:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Buffer sub-type</th>
<th>Data pointer</th>
<th>Resizable</th>
<th>Memory managed by</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fixed</td>
<td>Stable, non-NULL</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Duktape</td>
<td>Buffer size is fixed at creation, memory is managed automatically by
    Duktape.  Fixed buffers have an unchanging (stable) non-NULL data
    pointer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dynamic</td>
<td>Unstable, may be NULL</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Duktape</td>
<td>Buffer size can be changed after creation, memory is managed
    automatically by Duktape.  Requires two memory allocations internally
    to allow resizing.  Data pointer may change if buffer is resized.
    Zero-size buffer may have a NULL data pointer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>External</td>
<td>Unstable, may be NULL</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Duktape and user code</td>
<td>Buffer data is externally allocated.  Duktape allocates and manages
    a heap allocated buffer header structure, while the data area pointer
    and length are configured by user code explicitly.  External buffers
    are useful to allow a buffer to point to data structures outside
    Duktape heap, e.g. a frame buffer allocated by a graphics library.
    Zero-size buffer may have a NULL data pointer.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Unlike strings, buffer data areas are not automatically NUL-terminated
and calling code must never access bytes beyond the currently allocated
buffer size.  The data pointer of a zero-size dynamic or external buffer
may be NULL; fixed buffers always have a non-NULL data pointer.</p>

<p>Fixed and dynamic buffers are automatically garbage collected.  This
also means that C code must not hold onto a buffer data pointer unless the
buffer is reachable to Duktape, e.g. resides in an active value stack.
The data area of an external buffer is not automatically garbage collected
so user code is responsible for managing its life cycle.  User code must also
make sure that no external buffer value is accessed when the external buffer
is no longer (or not yet) valid.</p>

<p>Plain buffers mimic ArrayBuffer objects to a large extent, so they are
a non-standard, memory efficient alternative to working with e.g. ArrayBuffer
or typed arrays.  The standard buffer objects are implemented on top of plain
buffers, so that e.g. an ArrayBuffer will be backed by a plain buffer.  See
<a href="#bufferobjects">Buffer objects</a> for more discussion.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the value written to a buffer index is number coerced, assigning
a one-character value does not work as often expected.  For instance, 
<code>buf[123] = 'x'</code> causes zero to be written to the buffer, as
ToNumber('x') = 0.  For clarity, you should only assign number values,
e.g. <code>buf[123] = 0x78</code>.</li>
<li>There is a fast path for reading and writing numeric indices of plain buffer
values, e.g. <code>x = buf[123]</code> or <code>buf[123] = x</code>.  A similar
fast path exists for the different buffer object values.</li>
<li>Buffer virtual properties are not currently implemented in
<code>defineProperty()</code>, so you can't write to buffer indices or
buffer <code>length</code> with <code>defineProperty()</code> now (attempt
to do so results in a <code>TypeError</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="type-pointer">Pointer</h2>

<p>The <b>pointer</b> type is a raw, uninterpreted C pointer, essentially
a <code>void *</code>.  Pointers can be used to point to native objects (memory
allocations, handles, etc), but because Duktape doesn't know their use, they
are not automatically garbage collected.  You can, however, put one or more
pointers inside an object and use the object finalizer to free the
native resources related to the pointer(s).</p>

<h2 id="type-lightfunc">Lightfunc</h2>

<p>The <b>lightfunc</b> type is a plain Duktape/C function pointer and a small
set of control flags packed into a single tagged value which requires no separate
heap allocations.  The control flags (16 bits currently) encode:
(1) number of stack arguments expected by the Duktape/C function (0 to 14 or
varargs), (2) virtual <code>length</code> property value (0 to 15), and
(3) a magic value (-128 to 127).</p>

<p>Lightfuncs are a separate tagged type in the Duktape C API, but behave mostly
like Function objects for Ecmascript code.  They have significant limitations
compared to ordinary Function objects, the most important being:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightfuncs cannot hold own properties.  They have a fixed virtual <code>.name</code>
    property which appears in tracebacks, and a virtual <code>.length</code> property.
    Other properties are inherited from <code>Function.prototype</code>.</li>
<li>Lightfuncs can be used as constructor functions, but cannot have a
    <code>.prototype</code> property.  If you need to construct objects which
    don't inherit from <code>Object.prototype</code> (the default), you need to
    either (a) construct and return an instance explicitly in the constructor or
    (b) explicitly override the internal prototype of the default instance in the
    constructor.</li>
<li>Lightfuncs can be used as accessor properties (getters/setters), but they
    get converted to actual functions so that their memory advantage is lost.
    See
    <a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/tests/ecmascript/test-dev-lightfunc-accessor.js">test-dev-lightfunc-accessor.js</a>.</li>
<li>Lightfuncs cannot have a finalizer as they are a primitive type and
    don't have a reference count field or otherwise participate in garbage
    collection.  See
    <a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/tests/ecmascript/test-dev-lightfunc-finalizer.js">test-dev-lightfunc-finalizer.js</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lightfuncs are useful for very low memory environments where the memory
impact of ordinary Function objects matters.  See
<a href="#functionobjects">Function objects</a> for more discussion.</p>
