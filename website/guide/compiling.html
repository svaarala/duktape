<h1 id="compiling">Compiling</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Duktape doesn't have an official Makefile or a build script: given the
number of different portability targets, maintaining an official build
script would be difficult.  Instead, you should add Duktape to your existing
build process in whatever way is most natural.</p>

<p>Duktape is compiled with a C or C++ compiler (C99 is recommended)
and then linked to your program in some way; the exact details vary between
platforms and toolchains.  For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile Duktape together with your program without an explicit linking
    step.</li>
<li>Compile Duktape as a static library, and link the static library with
    your program.</li>
<li>Compile Duktape as a dynamic library, and link the dynamic library with
    your program (you'll need <code>DUK_OPT_DLL_BUILD</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two alternative distribution formats for the Duktape source:
a single source file and separate source files.  The single source file
version consists of <code>duktape.c</code>, <code>duktape.h</code>, and
<code>duk_config.h</code>.  The separate source files version consists of
<code>duktape.h</code>, <code>duk_config.h</code> and a set of separate
source files.   The single source file version is preferred, but separate
files work better with some toolchains.</p>

<p>All Duktape API functions are potentially macros, and the implementation
of a certain API primitive may change between a macro and an actual function
even between compatible releases.  This has two implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Include <code>duktape.h</code> in application code</b>.  This is
    good practice in general, but without the header your compiler will
    incorrectly assume that all Duktape API functions are actual functions
    which will cause linking to fail.</li>
<li><b>Compile Duktape and your application with the exactly same Duktape
    version</b>.  Even compatible versions may be binary incompatible
    because a function was changed into a macro or vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<p>Duktape has many features which can be controlled during compilation,
see feature options below.  Some options after binary compatibility of
Duktape and the application.  Because of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use the same feature options and the same compiler when compiling
    Duktape and your application</b>.  This is especially important when
    Duktape is compiled as a library in a separate step.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommended compiler options</h2>

<p>If you compile Duktape with no compiler options, Duktape will detect the
compiler and the platform automatically and select defaults appropriate in
most cases.  Recommended compiler options (for GCC/clang, use similar options
in your compiler):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-std=c99</code>: recommended to ensure C99 semantics
    which improve C type detection and allows Duktape to use variadic
    macros</li>
<li><code>-Os</code>: optimize for smallest footprint, which is usually
    desired when embedding Duktape</li>
<li><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>: omit frame pointer, further reduces
    footprint but may interfere with debugging (leave out from debug builds)</li>
<li><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code>: use strict aliasing rules, Duktape
    is compatible with these and they improve the resulting C code</li>
<li><code>-DDUK_OPT_DLL_BUILD</code>: needed when Duktape is built as a DLL
    (the option is needed for both Duktape and application build)</li>
<li>By default Duktape uses <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code>
    (or their variants) for internal long control transfers.  If you're
    compiling with a C++ compiler you may want to use
    <code>DUK_OPT_CPP_EXCEPTIONS</code> which causes Duktape to use C++
    exceptions for long control transfers and allows scope-based resource
    management (automatic destructors, etc) in Duktape/C functions to work
    as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're using Duktape on a platform where Duktape's automatic feature
detection doesn't (yet) work, you may need to force a specific byte order or
alignment requirements with feature options described below.</p>

<h2>Duktape feature defaults</h2>

<p>Duktape feature defaults are, at a high level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Ecmascript E5/E5.1 compliance
    (including the optional 
    <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-B">Annex B</a>
    features), except for intentional real world compatibility deviations
    (see <a href="#custombehavior">Custom behavior</a>)</li>
<li>Khronos/ES6 typed array and Node.js Buffer support</li>
<li>Some <a href="#es6features">features borrowed from ES6</a></li>
<li>Packed value representation (8 bytes per value) when available,
    unpacked value representation (usually bytes per value) when not</li>
<li>Reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage collection</li>
<li>Full error messages and tracebacks</li>
<li>No debug printing, no asserts, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually these automatic defaults are OK.  If you're working on a constrained
platform, you may need to add specific options to reduce memory footprint or to
minimize garbage collection pauses.</p>

<h2>Feature options (DUK_OPT_xxx)</h2>

<p>If you wish to modify the defaults, you can provide feature options in the
form of <code>DUK_OPT_xxx</code> compiler defines.  These will be taken into
account by the default <code>duk_config.h</code> file, which resolves the
final internal features based on feature requests, compiler features, and
platform features.  The full list of feature options is described in
<a href="http://wiki.duktape.org/FeatureOptions.html">Duktape feature options</a>
(if you're modifying <code>duk_config.h</code> directly, see
<a href="http://wiki.duktape.org/ConfigOptions.html">Duktape config options</a>).</p>

<p>See <a href="http://wiki.duktape.org/Configuring.html">Configuring Duktape for build</a>
for more practical details.</p>

<div class="note">
If you use Duktape feature options, you must define the feature options both
when compiling Duktape and when compiling any application code using the
<code>duktape.h</code> header.  This is necessary because some feature options
affect the binary compatibility of the Duktape API.
</div>

<h2>Suggested feature options for some environments</h2>

<h3 id="timing-sensitive-options">Timing sensitive options</h3>

<p>Timing sensitive applications include e.g. games.  For such environments
steady, predictable performance is important, often more important than
absolute performance.  Duktape provides some options to improve use in these
environments; for instance, you can disable automatic mark-and-sweep and rely
on reference counting and manually requested mark-and-sweep for garbage
collection.</p>

<p>See
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/timing-sensitive.rst">timing-sensitive.rst</a>
for suggested feature options.</p>

<h3 id="memory-constrained-options">Memory constrained options</h3>

<p>Duktape can work in 256kB flash memory (code footprint) and 96kB system
RAM (including Duktape and a minimal OS), and provides a lot of feature
options to minimize memory footprint.  These feature options are intended
for systems with less than 256kB of system RAM.</p>

<p>See
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/low-memory.rst">low-memory.rst</a>
for suggested feature options.</p>

<h3 id="performance-sensitive-options">Performance sensitive options</h3>

<p>The default Duktape build has reasonable performance options for most
environments.  Even so there are some feature options which
may be used to improve performance by e.g. enabling fast paths, enabling
"fastint" support, or trading some API safety for performance.</p>

<p>See
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/performance-sensitive.rst">performance-sensitive.rst</a>
for suggested feature options.</p>

<h2>DUK_OPT_PANIC_HANDLER</h2>

<p>The default panic handler will print an error message to stdout unless I/O is
disabled by <code>DUK_OPT_NO_FILE_IO</code>.  It will then call <code>abort()</code>
or cause a segfault if <code>DUK_OPT_SEGFAULT_ON_PANIC</code> is defined.</p>

<p>This is not always the best behavior for production applications which may
already have better panic recovery mechanisms.  To replace the default panic
handler, see
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/feature-options.rst">feature-options.rst</a>.</p>

<h2>Memory management alternatives</h2>

<p>There are three supported memory management alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reference counting and mark-and-sweep (default)</b>: heap objects are
    freed immediately when they become unreachable except for objects
    participating in unreachable reference cycles.  Such objects are freed by
    a periodic voluntary, stop the world mark-and-sweep collection.
    Mark-and-sweep is also used as the emergency garbage collector if
    memory allocation fails.</li>
<li><b>Reference counting only</b>: reduces code footprint and eliminates
    garbage collection pauses, but objects in unreachable reference cycles
    are not collected until the Duktape heap is destroyed.  This alternative
    is not recommended unless the reference cycles are not an issue.  See notes
    below.</li>
<li><b>Mark-and-sweep only</b>: reduces code footprint and memory footprint
    (heap headers don't need to store a reference count), but there is more
    memory usage variance than in the default case.  The frequency of voluntary,
    stop the world mark-and-sweep collections is also higher than in the default
    case where reference counting is expected to handle almost all memory
    management.</li>
</ul>

<p>When using only reference counting it is important to avoid creating
unreachable reference cycles.  Reference cycles are usually easy to avoid in
application code e.g. by using only forward pointers in data structures.  Even
if reference cycles are necessary, garbage collection can be allowed to work
simply by breaking the cycles before deleting the final references to such objects.
For example, if you have a tree structure where nodes maintain references to
both children and parents (creating reference cycles for each node) you could
walk the tree and set the parent reference to <code>null</code> before deleting
the final reference to the tree.</p>

<p>Unfortunately every Ecmascript function instance is required to be in a
reference loop with an automatic prototype object created for the function.
You can break this loop manually if you wish.  For internal technical reasons,
named function expressions are also in a reference loop; this loop cannot be
broken from user code and only mark-and-sweep can collect such functions.
See <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="duktape-date-provider">Using an external Date provider</h2>

<p>When porting to new or exotic platforms the Duktape built-in Date support
may not work on the platform.  In such a case you can implement an external
"Date provider" which allows you to provide the necessary date/time primitives
without Duktape changes. See
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/datetime.rst">datetime.rst</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="duktape-cplusplus">Using a C++ compiler</h2>

<p>Duktape works with both C and C++ compilers and applications.  You can
compile Duktape and the application with a C or a C++ compiler in any
combination.  Even so, it is recommended to compile both Duktape and the
application with the same compiler (i.e. both with a C compiler or both
with a C++ compiler) and with the same compiler options.</p>

<p>The <code>duktape.h</code> header contains the necessary glue to make all
of these combinations work.  Specifically, all symbols needed by Duktape
public API are inside a <code>extern "C" { ... }</code> wrapper (active only
if compiled with a C++ compiler).  This ensures that such symbols are defined
and used without C++ name mangling.  Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>When compiling Duktape itself with a C++ compiler, symbols needed by
    Duktape public API are not mangled.  Other Duktape internal symbols will
    be mangled, but are not externally visible and should thus cause no
    problems even if the application is compiled with a C compiler.</li>
<li>When compiling an application with a C++ compiler, the wrapper ensures
    that Duktape public API symbols used by the application are looked up
    without mangling.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mix C and C++ compilation, you should do the final linking with the
C++ toolchain.  At least when mixing gcc/g++ you may encounter something like:</p>
<pre>
$ g++ -c -o duktape.o -Isrc/ src/duktape.c
$ gcc -c -o duk_cmdline.o -Isrc/ examples/cmdline/duk_cmdline.c
$ gcc -o duk duktape.o duk_cmdline.o -lm -lreadline -lncurses
duktape.o:(.eh_frame+0x1ab): undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_v0'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</pre>

<p>One fix is to use <code>g++</code> for linking:</p>
<pre>
$ g++ -c -o duktape.o -Isrc/ src/duktape.c
$ gcc -c -o duk_cmdline.o -Isrc/ examples/cmdline/duk_cmdline.c
$ g++ -o duk duktape.o duk_cmdline.o -lm -lreadline -lncurses
</pre>

<p>Because <code>duktape.h</code> selects C/C++ data types needed by
Duktape and also does other feature detection, mixing C and C++ compilers
could theoretically cause the C and C++ compilers to end up with different
active features or data types.  If that were to happen, Duktape and the
application would be binary incompatible (which would be difficult to
diagnose).  This is usually not an issue, but to avoid the potential, compile
Duktape and the application with the same compiler.</p>

<p>By default scope-based resource management (sometimes referred to
as RAII) won't work in Duktape/C functions because Duktape uses
<code>longjmp()</code> for internal long control transfers, bypassing
C++ stack unwind mechanisms.  You can use <code>DUK_OPT_CPP_EXCEPTIONS</code>
to cause Duktape to use C++ exceptions for internal long control transfers,
which allows scope-based resource management to work in Duktape/C functions.</p>

<h2 id="installing-system-wide">Installing Duktape as a system-wide library</h2>

<p>Duktape can be installed as a system-wide library; see
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/system-install.rst">system-install.rst</a>.</p>

<h2>Compiler warnings</h2>

<p>Current goal is for the Duktape compile to be clean when:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a major compiler (e.g. gcc, clang, MSVC, mingw);</li>
<li>the compiler is in C99 mode; and</li>
<li>warnings are enabled (e.g. <code>-Wall</code> in gcc/clang).</li>
</ul>

<p>There are still some warnings present when you compile with
<code>-Wextra</code> or equivalent option.</p>

<p>There may be some warnings when compiling with a pre-C99 compiler
(or a C99 compiler without a <code>-std=c99</code> option or similar).</p>
