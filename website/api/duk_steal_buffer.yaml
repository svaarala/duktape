proto: |
  void *duk_steal_buffer(duk_context *ctx, duk_idx_t index, duk_size_t *out_size);

stack: |
  [ ... val! ... ]

summary: |
  <p>Steal the current allocation of the dynamic buffer at <code>index</code>.
  In concrete terms, Duktape forgets the previous allocation and resets the
  buffer to zero size (and NULL data pointer).  Pointer to the previous
  allocation is returned and previous allocation length is written to
  <code>out_size</code> if non-NULL.  The dynamic buffer itself remains on the
  value stack and can be reused.  The caller becomes responsible for freeing the
  previous allocation using <code><a href="#duk_free">duk_free()</a></code>,
  otherwise a memory leak happens.  Duktape won't free the previous allocation
  through garbage collection or even when the Duktape heap is destroyed.</p>

  <p>This API call is useful when a dynamic buffer is used as a safe temporary
  in a buffer manipulation algorithm (it's automatically memory managed in case
  an error occurs).  At the end of such an algorithm, the caller may want to
  steal the buffer so that it won't be freed by Duktape garbage collection even
  when the dynamic buffer itself is freed.</p>

example: |
  duk_size_t sz;
  void *ptr;

  ptr = duk_push_dynamic_buffer(ctx, 256);  /* initial size */
  for (;;) {
      /* Error prone algorithm, resizes and appends to buffer.  If an error
       * occurs, the dynamic buffer is automatically freed.
       */

      /* ... */
      duk_resize_buffer(ctx, -1, new_size);
  }

  /* Algorithm is done, we want to own the buffer.  The duk_steal_buffer()
   * API call returns the final data pointer (in case it has been changed
   * by resizes etc).
   */
  ptr = duk_steal_buffer(ctx, -1, &sz);

  /* At this point the dynamic buffer is still on the value stack.
   * Its size is zero and the current allocation is empty.  Here we
   * just pop it as unneeded.
   */
  duk_pop(ctx);

  /* ... */

  /* Eventually, when done with the buffer, you must free it yourself,
   * otherwise memory will be leaked.  Duktape won't free the allocation
   * automatically, even at Duktape heap destruction.
   */
  duk_free(ctx, ptr);
