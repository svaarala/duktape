[ ... ] -> [ ... stash! ]

=summary
<p>Push the heap stash object to the stack.  The heap stash is an internal
object which can be used to store key/value pairs from C code so that they are
reachable for garbage collection, but are not accessible from Ecmascript code.
The stash is only accessible from C code; the same stash object is used by all
code sharing the same Duktape heap (even if they don't share the same global
object).</p>
