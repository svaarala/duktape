void duk_gc(duk_context *ctx, duk_uint_t flags);

=summary
<p>Force a mark-and-sweep garbage collection round.  If mark-and-sweep is
disabled in the Duktape build, the call is a no-op.  The flags field is a
placeholder; no flags are defined at the moment.</p>

<p>You may want to call this function twice to ensure even objects with
finalizers are collected.  Currently it takes two mark-and-sweep rounds
to collect such objects.  First round marks the object as finalizable and
runs the finalizer.   Second round ensures the object is still
unreachable after finalization and then frees the object.</p>

=example
duk_gc(ctx, 0);
