duk_bool_t duk_is_constructor_call(duk_context *ctx);

=summary
<p>Return non-zero if current function was called as a constructor
(<code>new Foo()</code> instead of <code>Foo()</code>); otherwise returns 0.</p>

<p>This call allows a C function to have different behavior for normal
and constructor calls (as is the case for many built-in functions).</p>

=example
if (duk_is_constructor_call(ctx)) {
    printf("called as a constructor\n");
} else {
    printf("called as a normal function\n");
}
