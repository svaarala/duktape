void duk_push_current_function(duk_context *ctx);

=stack
[ ... ] -> [ ... func! ]  (if current function exists)
[ ... ] -> [ ... undefined! ]  (if no current function)

=summary
<p>Push the currently running function to the stack.  The value pushed is
an Ecmascript Function object.  If there is no current function,
<code>undefined</code> is pushed instead.</p>

<p>This function allows a C function to gain access to its function object.
Since multiple function objects can internally point to the same C function,
a function object is a convenient place for function parameterization and
can also act as an internal state stash.</p>
