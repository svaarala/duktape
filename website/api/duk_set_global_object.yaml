=summary
<p>Replace the current context's global object with the object on top of the
value stack.  If the value is not an object, an error is thrown.</p>

<p>Note that this operation <b>does not</b> affect the global object of other
contexts, even those that have up to this point shared the same global
environment.  To inherit the change to other contexts, replace the global
object first before calling <code>duk_push_thread()</code>.</p>

<p>See the test case
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/api-testcases/test-set-global-object.c">test-set-global-object.c</a>
for discussion of detailed behavior after the change.</p>

<div class="note">
This API call is experimental at present, and some of the semantics may
change when other sandboxing features are implemented.
