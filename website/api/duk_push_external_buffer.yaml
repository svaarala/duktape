name: duk_push_external_buffer

proto: |
  void duk_push_external_buffer(duk_context *ctx);

stack: |
  [ ... ] -> [ ... buf! ]

summary: |
  <p>Allocate an external buffer and push it to the value stack.  An external
  buffer refers to a user allocated external buffer which is not memory
  managed by Duktape.  The initial external buffer pointer is NULL and size
  is zero.  You can use
  <code><a href="#duk_config_buffer">duk_config_buffer()</a></code>
  to update the external buffer pointer and size.</p>

  <p>External buffers are useful to allow Ecmascript code access externally
  allocated data structures.  You can use it to e.g. write bytes to an
  externally allocated frame buffer.  The external buffer has no alignment
  requirements (Duktape makes no alignment assumptions when accessing it).</p>

example: |
  void *p;
  duk_size_t len;

  /* Allocate a frame buffer from a hypothetical graphics library.
   * The frame buffer is allocated outside of Duktape.
   */
  p = allocate_frame_buffer(1920 /*width*/, 1080 /*height*/);
  len = 1920 * 1080 * 4;

  /* Create an external buffer pointing to the frame buffer. */
  duk_push_external_buffer(ctx);
  duk_config_buffer(ctx, -1, p, len);

  /* Ecmascript code with access to the buffer object could now do
   * something like:
   *
   *    buf[100] = 123;
   *
   * Calling code must make sure Ecmascript never reads/writes an
   * external buffer whose backing buffer is no longer valid.
