[ ... ] -> [ ... thread! ]  (if current thread exists)
[ ... ] -> [ ... undefined! ]  (if no current thread)

=summary
<p>Push the currently running Duktape thread to the stack.  The value pushed
is a thread object which is also an Ecmascript object.  If there is no current
thread, <code>undefined</code> is pushed instead.</p>

<p>The current thread is (almost always) the thread represented by the
<code>ctx</code> pointer.</p>

<p>To get the <code>duk_context *</code> associated with the thread, use
<code><a href="#duk_get_context">duk_get_context()</a></code>.</p>

duk_push_thread(ctx);
